## Musashi - by Eiji Yoshikawa and Charles Terry
> Recommendation: 0 / 10
    
### Description
I don’t remember who told me this book was great, but I assumed it would have wisdom. It did not. It was 900 pages of poorly-written story. The few moments I enjoyed led to nothing. It was wasted time. I regret reading it.
    
### Notes
Instead of wanting to be like this or that, make yourself into a silent, immovable giant.<br>
Don’t waste your time trying to impress people.<br>
If you become the sort of man people can respect, they’ll respect you, without your doing anything.<br>
<br>
You want to be important? You shouldn’t aim so low.<br>
<br>
Be more careful about your manners.<br>
When people live together in harmony, the earth is a paradise.<br>
But every man has a bad side as well as a good side.<br>
Manners and etiquette keep us from letting the bad side take over.<br>
<br>
Trees and plants he wanted to grow would not grow, while weeds and brush flourished no matter how often he cut them down.<br>
Bad traits tend to develop and good ones to be repressed.<br>
<br>
Day and night, hour by hour, people are buffeted by waves of pain and pleasure, one after the other.<br>
If they try to experience only pleasure, they cease to be truly alive.<br>
If you can bear up under hardship, you can experience a pleasure greater than the pain.
