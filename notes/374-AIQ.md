> Recommendation: 0 / 10
    
### Description
It is interesting that this exists: a book written by a computer. The human authors created the questions. GPT-3 answered them. The humans published it only lightly edited. The content is supposed to be about the meaning of life, but the answers are extremely vague and uninteresting, no matter who “wrote” them. So, not worth reading, but worth knowing this exists and may become more common.
