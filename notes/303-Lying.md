## Lying - by Sam Harris
> Recommendation: 3 / 10
    
### Description
A tiny booklet, like a long article, about why lying is bad. Not as many insights as I expected.
    
### Notes
We often behave in ways that are guaranteed to make us unhappy.<br>
<br>
To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication.<br>
<br>
People lie so that others will form beliefs that are not true.<br>
<br>
All forms of lying - including white lies meant to spare the feelings of others - are associated with less satisfying relationships.<br>
<br>
Sincerity, authenticity, integrity, mutual understanding - these and other sources of moral wealth are destroyed the moment we deliberately misrepresent our beliefs.<br>
<br>
Among the many corrosive effects of unjust laws: They tempt peaceful and (otherwise) honest people to lie so as to avoid being punished for behavior that is ethically blameless.<br>
<br>
It is hard to abolish lies once they have escaped into the world.<br>
We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed.<br>
<br>
Peaceful, honest people have the right to be left alone.<br>
<br>
I’d call it “skillful truth-telling” as opposed to “evasion.”<br>
<br>
When you were doing all these charitable things, did you really care about the people you were doing these things for?<br>
<br>
When you care, you’ll know what to do.
