## Wild Problems - by Russ Roberts
> Recommendation: 9 / 10
    
### Description
How to improve your HUGE major life decisions, like whether/who to marry, whether to have kids, where to live, career paths, and such — where you can’t use the usual checklist/data approach. This economist addresses self-identity, “deepest self”, and “something I was meant to do”. You can’t use a pro/con checklist with an item that says “lose respect for myself”.
    
### Notes
A “wild problem”:<br>
a big decision where the right path isn’t obvious,<br>
where the pleasure and pain from choosing one path over another are ultimately hidden from us,<br>
where the path we choose defines who we are and who we might become.<br>
<br>
Whether to marry,<br>
who to marry,<br>
whether to have children,<br>
what career path to follow,<br>
how much time to devote to friends and family,<br>
how to resolve daily ethical dilemmas...<br>
These big decisions can’t be made with data, or science, or the usual rational approaches.<br>
<br>
When you focus on what you know and can imagine, you ignore your full range of choices.<br>
<br>
Important things are hard to measure.<br>
Measurable things are misleading.<br>
So what kind of decision framework is left?<br>
This book is my answer to that question.<br>
<br>
Face these problems without forgetting what’s at stake.<br>
<br>
Imagine the decision to become a vampire.<br>
Once you’ve made the leap into vampire world, and find you don’t care for it, you can’t go back.<br>
Once you become a vampire, your tastes will change.<br>
Which “you” should you consider when deciding what’s best for you?<br>
The current you or the you you will become?<br>
Many decisions involve burning bridges, crossing into a new experience that will change you in ways you can’t imagine.<br>
<br>
Leading decision expert said,<br>
«<br>
 I was trying to decide whether or not to move to Harvard from Stanford.<br>
 I had bored my friends silly with endless discussion.<br>
 Finally, one of them said, “You’re a leading decision theorist. Make a list of the costs and benefits and try to calculate your expected utility.”<br>
 Without thinking, I blurted out, “Come on, Sandy, this is serious.”<br>
»<br>
<br>
Make a list of costs and benefits to figure out what you’re “really after.”<br>
«I get half way through my balance sheet and say: Oh, hell, it’s not coming out right! Have to find a way to get some pluses over on the other side!»<br>
Flip a penny in the air. Not as the way to make the decision, but as the way to discover “what you’re hoping.”<br>
Where your heart lies.<br>
<br>
Why evoke an emotional reaction?<br>
To know how that choice is going to make us feel, not just physically but emotionally.<br>
<br>
Eudaemonia = “Flourishing”<br>
Becoming something beautiful and worthy of admiration.<br>
Fulfilling our human potential.<br>
To live life fully.<br>
<br>
Big decisions produce more than a stream of costs and benefits.<br>
Those choices define who you are, and affect your life’s meaning.<br>
The challenge of facing them when they don’t work out well is part of living as a human being.<br>
<br>
What would you give up to have a more meaningful life?<br>
What pleasure or consolation would compensate for failing to become the person you think you’re meant to become?<br>
<br>
Nothing cancels out betraying who you are or who you aspire to be.<br>
So you can’t add “losing respect for myself” as one of the costs on either side of the ledger.<br>
<br>
When thinking of pros and cons:<br>
Don’t mix flourishing with narrow utilitarianism.<br>
Think of each separately.<br>
Consider their relative pull in how you want to live.<br>
Bring the role of flourishing into the light.<br>
<br>
Flourishing is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from our day-to-day pleasures and pains.<br>
<br>
Purpose, meaning, dignity, and our sense of self:<br>
These are more important to our overall well-being than small and fleeting pleasures and pains.<br>
A fulfilling life, a life well lived, is about more than adding up pleasure and pain and trying to make the former greater than the latter.<br>
Well-being and flourishing persist and overlay your daily experiences.<br>
Who you are is more than what you experience.<br>
<br>
You gladly endure some suffering to achieve something you value deeply,<br>
even if the suffering lasts longer than the achievement's joy.<br>
You volunteer for heartache and unease. You like a challenge.<br>
Pain, especially when it’s in service of an ideal, can be a source of meaning.<br>
<br>
What kind of hiking trip do you want?<br>
Type 1 = nice the whole time. Nothing too stressful. You enjoy it while you’re in it and after. A day at the beach. A walk in the park.<br>
Type 2 = hard. Endure moments of pain, difficult days with steep climbs, crossing freezing streams, carrying heavy gear.<br>
But a Type 2 experience you never forget, makes you stronger, and when you overcome the obstacles you’ve accomplished something more than pleasant.<br>
You might not enjoy it (much) while you’re in the middle of it. But you enjoy it after it’s over.<br>
Marriage and parenting are much more Type 2 than Type 1.<br>

Invited to a job in Jerusalem. On narrow utilitarian grounds, this was a no-brainer. Only a fool would take the job. A number of friends and family told me to turn it down. But when it came to who I am and who I want to be, it was a no-brainer in the other direction.<br>
I took the job because I felt like it was something I was meant to do, a calling.<br>
To turn down the opportunity would have felt like a betrayal of the deepest parts of me.<br>
(But if my wife had opposed the decision, I would have turned it down.)<br>
<br>
Where we live is about who we are and not just what we experience.<br>
We became Israeli citizens, not to save some money on taxes, but for a change in our identity - our sense of self.<br>
<br>
You can spend all day in the pool having as much pleasure as possible and ignoring flourishing.<br>
Maybe it doesn’t matter to you.<br>
It’s easy to ignore the parts of life that are not easily imagined,<br>
 things you might enjoy once you’ve made a leap,<br>
 things that yield more pain than pleasure, day to day, but give your life purpose and meaning.<br>
<br>
A sunny pool and margarita are pleasures easily imagined.<br>
It’s harder to imagine a more meaningful life if you spent less time at the pool.<br>
<br>
Two ways to earn the praise, appreciation, admiration, and respect of the people around you.<br>
One way is to be rich, powerful, and famous.<br>
That gaudy and glittering path is easily noticed by many. It is seductive.<br>
The other is to be wise and virtuous.<br>
That path is not in the spotlight, and not as popular.<br>
It attracts those who themselves are wise and virtuous.<br>
If you care about flourishing, you have to work hard to keep the better path front and center.<br>

The secretary hiring algorithm. To maximize chance of marrying the best man among many suitors (hiring among applicants). Interview 37% of them. Don’t marry any of these. These interviews are a way to learn about the quality of what is available. Note the best one of the these, and use him as a measuring stick - the benchmark - for the remaining 63%. As soon as you reach someone better than that one, marry/hire him.<br>
In real life, this is more of an anti-lesson. The mathematical version of the question of who to marry is elegant, but not so good for living.<br>
<br>
With wild problems, the quest for the best is a mistake.<br>
The perfect is the enemy of the good. But the almost-perfect can be just as dangerous.<br>
The best spouse/partner/career/city doesn’t exist — not just because they’re hard to find. It’s not a meaningful concept.<br>
<br>
Satisficing is the best strategy.<br>
Realizing that it is time to make a decision and there is no reason to think there is a better option? That’s not settling. That’s deciding.<br>
<br>
Flaneurs wander not aimlessly, but thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
Life is like trying to plan a trip to Rome without a guidebook.<br>
Start by facing your ignorance.<br>
Some of us would love for someone to give us an itinerary to go with our trip to Rome - a tour bus where all the stops are preplanned because they’re the popular ones.<br>
But most of us would prefer to discover for ourselves what we love about Rome and what we might come to love.<br>
Wouldn’t you rather be surprised than have it all mapped out for you?<br>
Might travel with someone who can help you discover what Rome has to offer.<br>
Who might make a good traveling companion? No guidebook can tell you who to travel with.<br>
<br>
Unmarried friends create extraordinary friendships.<br>
<br>
How we treat those around us, defines us.<br>
Every day, we can see those around us as a way to flourish, or as a way to achieve a more utilitarian pleasure.<br>
Often these two forces compete.<br>
<br>
Allow another human being the chance to open their heart.<br>
<br>
Marriage turns love into loyalty.<br>
<br>
Privilege your principles.<br>
Put your principles above the day-to-day costs and benefits.<br>
Your decisions define who you are.<br>
Don’t make trade-offs when it comes to your essence.<br>
Live with integrity.<br>
Do the right thing and respect yourself.<br>
<br>
Have a rule. Try to follow the rule.<br>
You spend less time deliberating and suffering.<br>
You don’t agonize over whether following the rule is too costly or not in this particular case. You just follow the rule.<br>
<br>
My lesser self, the one I am rather than the one I want to be, will find a way to justify and rationalize.<br>
Rules prevent us from fooling ourselves.<br>
Rules maintain who we are, our sense of self.<br>
Rules help us become who we might want to become.<br>
<br>
Life isn’t just about who we are, but who we aspire to be.<br>
Right now, I may not care for opera. But I might aspire to appreciate it.<br>
Aspire to be a better person.<br>
Aspire to be a more reliable friend.<br>
<br>
Human beings are aspiring rather than desiring beings.<br>
We aspire more than we desire.<br>
<br>
Max Beerbohm story: “The Happy Hypocrite.”<br>
The face beneath the mask now matches what the mask displayed to the world.<br>
The inner man now matches the outer one.<br>
How is that possible? The answer is practice.<br>
Through changed behavior, he changes who he actually is.<br>
To get to where he wants to go, he wears the mask.<br>
He becomes that better person by actingj<br>
By performing the actions of a good person, he becomes that person.<br>
<br>
Practice at what you want to become.<br>
You can change your preferences.<br>
What once appealed to you can become unappealing.<br>
What you once found unappealing can potentially give you pleasure if you try it and persist at it.<br>
<br>
You have conflicting parts inside of you.<br>
Which one wins?<br>
The one you feed the most.<br>
<br>
The future is shrouded from us.<br>
Because we crave control and certainty, we want more information and better strategies.<br>
We’re better off trying to get used to the darkness.<br>
This goes against our nature. Uncertainty makes us anxious.<br>
<br>
Optionality is when you have the freedom to do something but not the obligation.<br>
Being able to change your mind, reverse your decisions, is optionality.<br>
<br>
Don’t agonize over whether anything is the right choice. Don’t waste time trying to get more information.<br>
Look for strategies to cope with the inevitable uncertainty.<br>
You can’t know in advance what will work.<br>
<br>
Widen your options.<br>
Have more experiences than fewer.<br>
Try stuff.<br>
Stop doing the stuff that isn’t for you.<br>
Admit that a decision you made didn’t work out.<br>
Embrace opportunities that make your heart sing.<br>
Spend less time trying to figure out in advance what those might be and more time taking chances as long as you can opt out at a low enough cost.<br>
Exploring can turn out much better than a planned itinerary.<br>
<br>
Life choices that turn out differently from what we hoped aren’t mistakes.<br>
They’re just choices that turned out differently than we hoped.<br>
We shouldn’t call those mistakes.<br>
They’re more like adventures.<br>
<br>
Go on an adventure that you can end without great cost.<br>
It turns out badly, cut it short.<br>
If it turns out well, enjoy the ride.<br>
This beats trying to figure out in advance which adventures are the best ones.<br>
<br>
Grit and persistence are overrated.<br>
Take advantage of optionality when you can.<br>
Visit a place before you move there.<br>
Don’t finish every book you start.<br>
<br>
The specter of regret makes us fear making any decision at all.<br>
<br>
More information is just a form of procrastination.<br>
<br>
The only way to understand whether a certain career path is right for you is to actually try it for an extended period.<br>
Those who hover on the edge of a commitment, reluctant to make a decision until all the facts are in, will eventually find that life has passed them by.<br>
The only way to understand a way of life is to take the risk of living it.<br>
<br>
Poets, sculptors, novelists, and composers learn about what they are crafting in the process of crafting it.<br>
<br>
If you always or too often say no, you’ll miss a chance to connect with someone - you’ll reduce the amount of serendipity in your life.<br>
Taking advantage of optionality means:<br>
Say yes to things that are not obviously worth doing but have the chance to expand your horizons, your experiences, your connections.
