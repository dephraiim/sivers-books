<br>
Writing within an artificially imposed constraint.<br>
<br>
Today I have learned a great lesson. Our cook was my teacher. She is 25 years old and she’s French. I discovered, when I asked her, that she did not know that Louis-Philippe is no longer king of France and we now have a republic. And yet it has been 5 years since he left the throne. She said the fact that he is no longer king simply does not interest her in the least - those were her words. And I think of myself as an intelligent man! But compared to her I’m an imbecile.<br>
<br>

<br>
In my communications to her, though to no one else, I tend to put certain words into quotation marks, as for instance “society,” “we,” “poetry,” “happiness.”<br>
Why to Rae in particular, and what do the quotation marks do?<br>

Subtly, or less subtly, you always want to surprise a reader.<br>
You certainly don’t want the reader to predict exactly where you’re about to go.<br>
<br>
Qualifying words like quite and rather and very - you probably could benefit by taking them out.<br>
<br>
End with the more surprising or stronger element.<br>
<br>
You may see that your best ending is somewhere up the page - that you were finished before you thought you were.<br>
<br>
The title is essential to place the reader before the beginning of the piece.<br>
<br>
Work hard on the very last words - they can sometimes make all the difference -  (as to whether or not a story or poem seems finished.)<br>
<br>
When you revise a sentence you are revising not only the words of the sentence but also the thought in the sentence.<br>
<br>
By getting a certain description exactly right, I am sharpening the acuteness of my observation.<br>
<br>
Every story is written entirely in the notebook.<br>
In the notebook nothing has to be permanent or good. Here I have complete freedom and so I am not afraid.<br>
I could write in whatever way I wanted.<br>
For a while I pushed myself out of a dry spell by writing two paragraph-long stories every day.<br>
<br>
I don’t deliberately set out to write stories.<br>
<br>
The notebook is a place to get rid of everything.<br>
