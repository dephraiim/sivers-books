## The Tao of Wu - by RZA
> Recommendation: 3 / 10
    
### Description
Founder of Wu-Tang Clan tells his tale and philosophy. But while the symbolism of Shaolin inspired him, it wasn’t communicated in this book as anything useful. Still, could be a good for a below-the-surface reflection for how this mental association turned into better actions for him.
    
### Notes
Find an island.<br>
Find a place where this culture can’t take energy from you, sap your will and originality.<br>
Since anything physical can be mental, that island can be your home.<br>
Turn off the electromagnetic waves being forced upon you, the countless invisible forces coming at you all the time.<br>
Find an island; turn inward; discover your true strength.
