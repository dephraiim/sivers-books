## Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) - by Carol Tavris
> Recommendation: 3 / 10
    
### Description
We are wired for self-justification. We create fictions that absolve us of responsibility, restoring our belief that we are smart, moral, and right — a belief that often keeps us on a course that is dumb, immoral, and wrong.
    
### Notes
Irrefutable evidence is rarely enough to pierce the mental armor of self-justification.<br>
<br>
There is no such thing as a conscious hypocrite.<br>
<br>
When he came to believe in something, he would believe in it totally, with absolute conviction, regardless of previous beliefs, or of the facts in the matter.<br>
He had a remarkable capacity to convince himself that he held the principles he should hold at any given time.<br>
There was something charming about the air of injured innocence with which he would treat anyone who brought forth evidence that he had held other views in the past.<br>
It was not an act.<br>
He had a fantastic capacity to persuade himself that the ‘truth’ which was convenient for the present was the truth and anything that conflicted with it was the prevarication of enemies.<br>
He literally willed what was in his mind to become reality.<br>
<br>
Someone who has justified his actions to himself, believing that he has the truth, becomes impervious to self-correction.<br>
<br>
Self-justification has costs and benefits.<br>
By itself, it’s not necessarily a bad thing.<br>
It lets us sleep at night.<br>
Without it, we would prolong the awful pangs of embarrassment.<br>
We would torture ourselves with regret over the road not taken or over how badly we navigated the road we did take.<br>
We would agonize in the aftermath of almost every decision.<br>
<br>
How can we learn from our mistakes, unless we first admit that we made any?<br>
