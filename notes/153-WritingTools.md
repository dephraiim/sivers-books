## Writing Tools - by Roy Peter Clark
> Recommendation: 7 / 10
    
### Description
Great advice on how to be a better writer. Unfortunately the author’s writing style is distracting. How strange to take advice from someone not taking it themselves. Like a drunk telling you not to drink. Right after reading this book I gave it a terrible rating because of that, but now I realize its points and advice (in my notes, below) are truly great.
    
### Notes
Begin sentences with subjects and verbs. Make meaning early. Place emphatic words in a sentence at the end.<br>
<br>
The 2-3-1 tool of emphasis: the most emphatic words or images go at the end, the next most emphatic at the beginning, and the least emphatic in the middle.<br>
<br>
The difference between a good adverb and a bad adverb?  Compare “She smiled happily” and “She smiled sadly.”  “Sadly” is good because it changes the meaning.<br>
<br>
It took several years and hundreds of readings before I noticed I had written “create” and “creating” in the same sentence. It was easy enough to cut “creating,” giving the stronger verb form its own space. Word territory.<br>
<br>
The power of the written word is to make you hear, to make you feel, to make you see.<br>
<br>
In his book 100 Ways to Improve Your Writing, Gary Provost created this tour de force to demonstrate what happens when the writer experiments with sentences of different lengths:<br>
This sentence has five words.<br>
Here are five more words.<br>
Five-word sentences are fine.<br>
But several together become monotonous.<br>
Listen to what is happening.<br>
The writing is getting boring.<br>
The sound of it drones.<br>
It’s like a stuck record.<br>
The ear demands some variety.<br>
Now listen.<br>
I vary the sentence length, and I create music.<br>
Music.<br>
The writing sings.<br>
It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony.<br>
I use short sentences.<br>
And I use sentences of medium length.<br>
And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals - sounds that say listen to this, it is important.<br>
<br>
The purpose of paragraphing is to give the reader a rest. The writer is saying: ‘Have you got that? If so, I’ll go on to the next point.’<br>
<br>
Paragraphing is also a matter of the eye. A reader will address himself more readily to his task if he sees from the start that he will have breathing-spaces from time to time than if what is before him looks like a marathon course.<br>
<br>
If a writer wants the reader to think something is the absolute truth, the writer should render it in the shortest possible sentence. Trust me.<br>
<br>
In the anti-math of writing, the number three is greater than four. The mojo of three offers a greater sense of completeness than four or more.<br>
<br>
Use one for power.<br>
Use two for comparison, contrast.<br>
Use three for completeness, wholeness, roundness.<br>
Use four or more to list, inventory, compile, and expand.<br>
<br>
When the topic is most serious, understate; when least serious, exaggerate.<br>
<br>
Understatement = “Pay no attention to the writer behind the curtain. Look only at the world.”<br>
Hyperbole = “Watch me dance. Aren’t I a clever fellow?”<br>
<br>
“If it sounds like writing, rewrite it.” &nbsp;— Elmore Leonard<br>
<br>
Readers read for two reasons: information and experience. There’s the difference.<br>
Reports convey information. Stories create experience.<br>
Reports transfer knowledge. Stories transport the reader, crossing boundaries of time, space, and imagination.<br>
Reports point us there. Stories put us there.<br>
<br>
The famous “Five Ws and H”: Watch what happens when we unfreeze them, when information is transformed into narrative:<br>
<br>
Who becomes Character.<br>
What becomes Action.  (What happened.)<br>
Where becomes Setting.<br>
When becomes Chronology.<br>
Why becomes Cause or Motive.<br>
How becomes Process.  (How it happened.)<br>
<br>
Elmore Leonard: “Leave out the part that readers tend to skip.”<br>
But which part is that?<br>
“Thick paragraphs of prose you can see have too many words in them. The writer has gone into the character’s head.  BUT: I’ll bet you don’t skip dialogue.”<br>
<br>
Human speech, captured as dialogue on the page, attracts the eyes of the reader and, if done well, advances the story.<br>
<br>
Foreshadow conclusions. Plant important clues early.<br>
<br>
Learn how to craft the cliffhanger.  “And there stood one of the oddest human beings I’d ever laid eyes on.”<br>
The simple need to learn what he looks like drove me to the next chapter.<br>
<br>
Build your work around a key question.
