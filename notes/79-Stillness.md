### Notes
Stillness aims the archer’s arrow.<br>
<br>
Stillness sharpens perspective and illuminates connections.<br>
<br>
Stillness generates a vision, helps us resist the passions of the mob.<br>
<br>
A leader and decision maker's job is not to “go with the gut” or fixate on the first impression formed an issue.<br>
Be strong enough to resist thinking that is too neat, too plausible, and therefore almost always wrong.<br>
<br>
Be fully present.<br>
Empty our mind of preconceptions.<br>
Take our time.<br>
Sit quietly and reflect.<br>
Reject distraction.<br>
Weigh advice against the counsel of our convictions.<br>
Deliberate without being paralyzed.<br>
Cultivate mental stillness.<br>
<br>
The hardest thing is actually doing something that is close to nothing.<br>
It demands all of you.<br>
There is no object to hide behind. It’s just you.<br>
<br>
See the world like an artist: the mind, fully engaged, notice what really surrounds you.<br>
<br>
Don’t reject a difficult or boring moment because it is not exactly what you want.<br>
<br>
Napoleon told messengers to wake him with crisis immediately, but wait three weeks before opening any correspondence. When he finally did hear what was in a letter, Napoleon loved to note how many supposedly “important” issues had simply resolved themselves and no longer required a reply.<br>
<br>
Filter out the inconsequential from the essential.<br>
<br>
It’s very difficult to think or act clearly when we are drowning in information.<br>
<br>
Limit the amount of people who have access to the boss.<br>
Gatekeepers: no more drop-ins, tidbits, and stray reports.<br>
So the boss can see the big picture.<br>
So the boss has time and room to think.<br>
Because if the boss doesn’t, then nobody can.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’<br>
It means questioning that “open door” policy, or even where you live.<br>
<br>
We are afraid of being the bad guy who says, “Nope, not interested.”<br>
<br>
Chop wood, carry water. Don’t overanalyze. Do the work.<br>
<br>
That space between your ears - that’s yours.<br>
Control what gets in.<br>
Control what goes on in there.<br>
Protect it from yourself, from your own thoughts.<br>
<br>
Philosopher examines our impressions and thoughts to make sure we aren’t led astray by appearances or missing what couldn’t be seen by the naked eye.<br>
<br>
Do the kind of thinking that 99% of the population is just not doing.<br>
Stop doing the destructive thinking that they spend 99% of their time doing.<br>
<br>
journal/diary: Paper has more patience than people.<br>
<br>
John Cage 4′33″ was never about achieving perfect silence - it’s about what happens when you stop contributing to the noise.<br>
<br>
Wisdom is a sense of the big picture, the accumulation of experience and the ability to rise above the biases, the traps that catch lazier thinkers.<br>
<br>
Add experience and experimentation on top of this. Put yourself in tough situations. Accept challenges. Familiarize yourself with the unfamiliar.<br>
<br>
Egomaniacs are the least peaceful.<br>
Their mind is swirling in their own grandiosity and insecurity.<br>
They constantly bite off more than they can chew.<br>
Everything with them is complicated, everything is about them.<br>
<br>
Confidently embrace change.<br>
It's swapping an incorrect opinion for a correct one.<br>
It's not an admission of inferiority.<br>
<br>
Both egotistical and insecure people make their flaws central to their identity.<br>
<br>
The closer we get to mastery, the less we care about specific results.<br>
<br>
Mental stillness will be short-lived if our hearts are on fire, or our souls ache with emptiness.<br>
<br>
A virtuous life is worthwhile for its own sake.<br>
<br>
Form a moral code, or you'll have to belabor every decision and consider every temptation.<br>
What do you stand for?<br>
What do you believe to be essential and important?<br>
What are you really living for?<br>
<br>
Develop good character so when it counts, you will not flinch. So that when everyone else is scared and tempted, you will be virtuous. You will be still.<br>
<br>
Give more.<br>
Give what you didn’t get.<br>
Love more.<br>
Drop the old story.<br>
<br>
Ask when pulled by a strong desire:<br>
What will happen to me if I get what I want?<br>
How will I feel after?<br>
Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all the changes which you are looking forward to were done.<br>
Would this be a great joy and happiness to you?<br>
No!<br>
(At this my heart sank within me: the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down.)<br>
<br>
Cultivate a poet’s eye - the ability to see beauty everywhere, even in the banal or the terrible.<br>
<br>
Nature is a cure-all, a comfort available to any and all who suffer.<br>
(Shinrin yoku: forest bathing.)<br>
<br>
Addiction is becoming obsessed with yourself and the primacy of your urges and thoughts.<br>
<br>
A life solely about work and doing is terribly out of balance.<br>
<br>
Love is the great educator. We learn when we give it. We learn when we get it. We get closer to stillness through it.<br>
<br>
Conservation of energy:<br>
Never stand up when you can sit down, and never sit down when you can lie down.<br>
So that you never shirk from a task, or back down from a challenge.<br>
So that you never burn yourself out or snuff out the spark of joy that makes life worth living.<br>
<br>
Churchill chose an unexpected form of leisure: bricklaying.<br>
Bricklaying didn’t wear down his body, it invigorated him.<br>
He loved the slow, methodical process.<br>
<br>
Find new activities that use other parts of your mind and body to relieve the areas where you are overworked.<br>
Have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real.<br>
<br>
Every prophet is forced into the wilderness, where they undergo solitude, deprivation, reflection, and meditation. Psychic dynamite comes from this physical ordeal.<br>
<br>
Leave written works behind you.<br>
Be financially prudent and provide for the future.<br>
Cherish country living.<br>
<br>
Develop a reliable, disciplined routine.<br>
<br>
Movement through a beautiful setting can unlock a different kind of stillness than traditional meditation.<br>
<br>
A good routine is not only a source of great comfort and stability, it’s the platform from which stimulating and fulfilling work is possible.<br>
<br>
Repetition is a form of mesmerism. Mesmerize yourself to reach a deeper state of mind.<br>
<br>
Poet John Milton was up at 4 a.m. to read and contemplate, so that by 7 a.m. he was ready to be “milked” by his writing.<br>
<br>
Conflicting impulses, incentives, inclinations, and external interruptions are no path to stillness and not a way to get the best out of yourself.<br>
<br>
Automate and routinize the trivial parts of life, but also make automatic good and virtuous decisions, to free up resources to do important and meaningful exploration.<br>
Buy room for peace and stillness, and thus make good work and good thoughts accessible and inevitable.<br>
<br>
Limit the number of choices you need to make.<br>
<br>
The wealthy man has vast estates that lord over him rather than the other way around.<br>
The gentleman makes things his servants.<br>
The petty man is servant to things.<br>
<br>
Diogenes supposedly lived in a barrel and walked around nearly naked.<br>
When he saw a child drinking water from a well with his hands, Diogenes smashed his own cup, realizing that he had been carrying around an extraneous possession.<br>
<br>
Alexander the Great could neither tempt Diogenes with any favors nor deprive him of anything<br>
If a man can reduce his needs to zero, he is truly free. There is nothing that can be taken from him and nothing anyone can do to hurt him.<br>
<br>
Solitude allows you to reflect while others are reacting.<br>
<br>
Solitude is the school of genius.<br>
The crowded, busy world is the purgatory of the idiot.<br>
<br>
Solitude without purpose is a killer of creativity.<br>
<br>
Leisure is activity. What is absent is any external justification - you can’t do leisure for pay, you can’t do it to impress people. You have to do it for you.<br>
Let it relax you and give you peace.<br>
<br>
Find a pursuit that simultaneously challenges and relaxes you.<br>
To do leisure well, don't let it turn into a job.<br>
<br>
Stillness is not an excuse to withdraw from the affairs of the world. Quite the opposite - it’s a tool to let you do more good for more people.
