How to write a non-fiction book so useful to people that they recommend it to others. A great step-by-step methodology from someone experienced, who’s done it successfully a few times already.
    
### Notes
The goal of book marketing is to stop needing to do it.<br>
Investing loads of time into active, hands-on marketing is unlikely to sell enough copies per hour to return a meaningful income.<br>
Invest 100% of your effort into creating the most useful book possible - testing it with real readers at every step - so you can treat marketing as an afterthought.<br>
<br>
Why are you writing?<br>
* Beginnings - to explore, plant a flag, and build a reputation in an interesting space where you intend to remain<br>
* Closure - to capture the lessons learned from some stage of life, allowing you to move on<br>
* Impact - to spread important knowledge beyond your direct reach<br>
* Curiosity - to spend the time researching, wrestling with, and deeply understanding an irresistible topic<br>
<br>
Writing is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.<br>
<br>
Divide nonfiction books into two categories by their purpose to the reader:<br>
Pleasure-givers (“interesting”, “fascinating”, “beautiful”)<br>
Problem-solvers (“useful”, “actionable”, “clarifying”)<br>
<br>
Nearly all of the advice you’ve ever heard about “writing a book” is actually about writing a pleasure-giving book, and is at best irrelevant and often harmful when applied to a problem-solving book.<br>
<br>
Make a clear promise and put it on the cover.<br>
<br>
To find the right words to clearly and concisely describe your book’s promise, try it out in conversation.<br>
Describe the book in just one or two sentences.<br>
Then shut up and listen to them completely misinterpret and misunderstand what you’re trying to do.<br>
Each time you try describing it to someone, you’ll get a little bit closer.<br>
Once people are immediately getting it - without requiring you to clarify or correct anything substantial - then you’ll know you’ve found the words.<br>
Put them on your cover.<br>
<br>
Nobody recommends the second-best solution. So you need to become the best.<br>
When someone decides to buy and read your book, what are they trying to achieve or accomplish with it? Why are they bothering?<br>
After finishing it, what’s different in their life, work, or worldview?<br>
<br>
What does your ideal reader already know and believe?<br>
If they already know the basics, then you can skip those.<br>
Who is your book not for and what is it not doing?<br>
<br>
A book’s organic growth will live or die based on its recommendation loop.<br>
<br>
Test and iterate on your book’s underlying scope and structure without worrying about its words, and without needing to rewrite anything larger than a table of contents.<br>
Verify and improve your scope.<br>
Refine your table of contents and iterate on the book’s underlying education design and structure.<br>
<br>
Don’t ask for opinions about your book idea (“So what do you think?”). That is just fishing for compliments.<br>
Listening - a friendly exploration of the reader’s experiences, worldview, and decision-making:<br>
You’ve been dealing with X recently, right?<br>
Would you mind talking me through what you did and how it went?<br>
How did you decide to do it that way?<br>
What else did you try?<br>
What did you give up on or find unhelpful?<br>
Where did you search for help or guidance?<br>
What were the most frustrating moments?<br>
How did you eventually get over them?<br>
Did you read any books or blogs about it?<br>
Why (or why not)?<br>
Which ones were helpful and which were a waste? Why?<br>
What’s still worrying or blocking you?<br>
Are you doing anything about it, or is it not that big of a deal?<br>
These sorts of conversations are not about pitching (or even describing) your book idea.<br>
You want insights into their life, not opinions about your idea.<br>
<br>
Decribing your book suggests that you’ve already figured out the details (which discourages big-picture feedback).<br>
<br>
Become the book and teach its contents to your future readers.<br>
By helping them through the process yourself, you’ll learn what they need, and in what order.<br>
You’ll figure out which examples resonate and which exercises work.<br>
Volunteer to give them free, expert guidance about an outcome that they care about.<br>
Instead of attempting to believe that your advice is worth sharing, go out and prove that it is by helping real people and seeing if it works.<br>
<br>
Record the first draft as audio and use an AI transcription service.<br>
<br>
If I don’t do my writing first thing, then I don’t do my writing.<br>
<br>
Readers will feel engaged and rewarded so long as it regularly delivers the next piece of whatever they were promised on the cover.<br>
<br>
Arrange the content around the learner’s goals.<br>
<br>
Read it all every day from the start, correcting as you go along.<br>
Then go on from where you stopped the day before.<br>
When it gets so long that you can’t do this every day, read back two or three chapters each day.<br>
Then each week read it all from the start.<br>
That’s how you make it all of one piece.<br>
<br>
Re-read your draft like it’s your worst enemy’s magnum opus and your job is to expose its every tragic flaw.<br>
<br>
Beta readers are neither paid professionals nor kindhearted friends.<br>
They are actual, honest-to-god readers who want what you’re creating so badly that they’re willing to endure an early, awkward, broken manuscript just to get it.<br>
<br>
Beta reading begins after the third-ish draft, but before any sort of professional editing.<br>
If you’re using a developmental editor, they’ll get involved while beta reading is still happening, offering an expert perspective to complement the feedback from your readers.<br>
<br>
Run at least two full iterations of beta reading, which should take one to four months.<br>
Continue iterating and improving until your beta readers have shown you that you’re finished.<br>
<br>
Once you’re ready for beta readers, copy/export the manuscript into a cloud-hosted tool with live commenting.<br>
Allow people to comment/suggest, but not edit.<br>
We built a tool specifically for better beta reading called Help This Book. &lt;https://www.usefulbooks.com/&gt;<br>
<br>
I can rarely predict which specific parts of a book will be most valued or enjoyed.<br>
But once the best bits have been identified, I can easily go through the rest of the manuscript and add more moments like them.<br>
Identify where readers are quietly giving up and abandoning the book.<br>
<br>
Follow up to see whether the book actually worked.<br>
<br>
Launch is a year, not a day.<br>
<br>
Amazon: tipping point of credibility at around 20-40 reviews, so it’s worth going out of your way to encourage (authentic) reviews until reaching that number.<br>
Amazon description: explicitly list the book’s promise and benefits to their life, at least five paragraphs.<br>
Use visual callouts (like headers, lists, and bold text) to grab the eye and allow for skimming.<br>
A hidden “flag” gets thrown within Amazon’s systems after a book has received organic purchases for five days in a row.<br>
<br>
Start by picking the book’s five most compelling learning outcomes.<br>
<br>
Whenever a reader asks a question, instead of sending an email reply, I record the answer as a public video on my YouTube channel and send them a link.<br>
It doubles as a permanent piece of content to help build my fledgling audience.
