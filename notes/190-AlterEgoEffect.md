## The Alter Ego Effect - by Todd Herman
> Recommendation: 6 / 10
    
### Description
Great idea: that you should create an inner hero that you bring out when performing. Athletes do this: when they compete they are “The Ghost Panther” (or whatever) in their mind, not their normal self. I've done and prescribed this for 20 years, so it's cool to read a book on the subject. The point is simple. The book is filled with many anecdotes.
    
### Notes
Sacrifice what you are for what you could become.<br>
<br>
Suspend who you’ve been and let another version of yourself show up.<br>
<br>
Be intentional about who (what kind of person) needs to show up - what characteristics that will help you succeed.<br>
What are the traits, capabilities, skills, attitudes, beliefs, values, and all the other bits and pieces that you need to succeed?<br>
<br>
Someone changing something is wanting: Stopping, Starting, Continuing, Less of, More of.<br>
We live in four planes: Thinking, feeling, doing, and experiencing.<br>
Combine them to ask yourself what you want. (Stop doing, start doing, continue thinking, experience less of, feel more of, etc.)<br>
It could be double-negatives like “Stop seeing my day wasted.”<br>
<br>
End-in-mind: definine your final outcome or goal, then work backward from that target to build a strategy and plan to reach the goal.<br>
If you’re walking aimlessly, it’s most likely because you haven’t defined a destination, goal, or outcome and you’re just doing.<br>
Work backward to map out a plan with the steps that will ensure it happens.<br>
<br>
Moments of Impact: the actions, opportunities, events, situations, or expectations with the greatest impact on your success.<br>
Moments of Impact are filled with the most resistance, most emotion, and most challenge because they occur when you might be the most vulnerable.<br>
(Putting your words on paper and writing, Making a speech in front of a crowd, Investing your money, speaking publicly, networking or meeting someone for the first time.)<br>
These moments will give you the highest rate of return.<br>
<br>
Are administrative tasks your Moments of Impact? Probably not. They’re responsibilities, but they’re not going to catapult your career.<br>
Those tasks can be the obstacles to your Moment of Impact.<br>
<br>
Name your psychological enemy.<br>
Make it something to defeat, something to overcome, something to battle against.<br>
Humiliate it. Make the Enemy as small as possible.<br>
<br>
There is no faster way to evoke a strong emotion than to tell or hear a compelling story.<br>
We feel stories. Those emotions prompt us to act.<br>
<br>
I cared so much about what other people thought of me and whether they liked me that it held me back.<br>
“If I did that, my people would think I’m a sellout.”<br>
<br>
Have indifference to the opinions of others.<br>
<br>
The good things we build end up building us.<br>
<br>
We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.<br>
<br>
If you’re not willing to risk the unusual, you’ll have to settle for the ordinary.<br>
<br>
People have a hard time answering: “What do you want?”<br>
But if you ask, “What don’t you want?”, you get a flood of don’ts:<br>
It’s so much easier to create a Don’t Want list.<br>
<br>
When naming what you want, sound egotistical.<br>
(People fear sounding egotistical when naming what they want, and therefore don't say what they really want. So to counteract that, aim to sound egotistical.)<br>
<br>
What you need to believe to make those actions effortless, joyful, or more comfortable?<br>
Valuing action over perfection?<br>
More optimistic about your ability to make a difference?<br>
Love failing, because you know you’re improving and taking action!<br>
<br>
Imagine the specific behaviors and actions that you’re taking in your Extraordinary World.<br>
<br>
The obsession with “happiness” is causing people to feel empty.<br>
People who pursued activities only for personal pleasure lacked a sense of meaning in their lives.<br>
<br>
The motivations of all the great heroes: Trauma, Destiny, Altruism, or Self-expression.<br>
Self-expression is “I wonder what I can do/create/find?” — motivated to uncover “what they’re made of” and love the creative, athletic, or scientific process.<br>
<br>
Negative emotions like rage and anger can be incredibly motivating, especially in the beginning, when you’re taking a new action and trying to build momentum.<br>
Whatever gets you moving is all that matters.<br>
<br>
Your “why” has to be deeply meaningful to you..<br>
<br>
Asking yourself challenging or difficult questions like “what do you want?” or “why do you want something?” can tie you up in a psychological knot.<br>
Self-distancing helps: take a step back when thinking about past experiences and reason about them from the perspective of a distanced observer, akin to a fly on the wall.<br>
“Why does ‘Jane’ want to write bestselling novels?”<br>
“What’s the purpose of ‘Todd’s’ life?”<br>
This third-person language creates an observer-type effect and can allow you to gain perspective.<br>
<br>
Start with someone you already admire and ask yourself why.<br>
<br>
The best Alter Ego is the one you have the deepest emotional connection with.<br>
<br>
If you were prolific at what you do: How would you think about yourself? What attitudes would you have about business? Your skills in business? What beliefs would you have? How would you carry yourself physically?<br>
<br>
What propels your Alter Ego to stand up to the Enemy and to defeat it at every turn?<br>
Your Alter Ego’s Origin Story.<br>
<br>
Don’t overlook the power of using placebo to trigger your Alter Ego.<br>
<br>
Write out a Response Proclamation in response to the question, “Who do you think you are?”<br>
It can be from your history or your Alter Ego’s history.<br>
<br>
Go to a local coffee shop as your Alter Ego.<br>
Meditate as your Alter Ego.
