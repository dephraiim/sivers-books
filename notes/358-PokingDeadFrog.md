## Poking a Dead Frog - by Mike Sacks

### Description
I thought it was going to be about the craft of comedy, but it was mostly about the business: TV staff writers talking shop.
    
### Notes
Avoid anything you feel is a cheap laugh based on shock or just being dirty. You can always get a laugh, but you don’t want it to come at the price of your dignity.<br>
<br>
Writers tend to write ordinary people in weird situations.<br>
Performers tend to write weird people in ordinary situations.<br>
<br>
Writers are obsessed, with originality.<br>
We must always move forward, never backward.<br>
So that once something has been done, it should perhaps be built upon, but never, ever repeated.<br>
For performers, the fact that something has been done before isn't a problem.<br>
<br>
People get extremely angry when you create comedy that isn’t funny.<br>
<br>
Make everything as personal and specific as you can.<br>
It works when screenwriters make their writing too specific to their own lives. The specificity makes it brilliant.<br>
<br>
“Midnight Run” : the tightest screenplay ever written - not one wasted word - and a dozen indelible characters with strong personalities, each with specific goals and realistic motivations.<br>
<br>
Sadly, the world - and you might not know this - is imperfect.  (I like the comic placement of the middle phrase.)<br>
<br>
The best ending for a story is at once inevitable and surprising. That it was the only way it could’ve happened, and yet the audience didn’t see it coming.<br>
<br>
Anything I’ve ever written that I felt was really great, I inevitably will look at two years later and think, Oh, God, this is so amateurish and terrible. But that’s a good thing.<br>
Your attitude has to constantly be, “Who is this rank amateur, and how can I teach him how to write?”<br>
<br>
The teacher would write a phrase from a Shakespeare play on the board.<br>
We had two minutes to think, eight minutes to compose, two minutes to correct, and then we put our pencils down: 2-8-2.<br>
That is how you train writers.<br>
When writers have all the time in the world, we don’t do shit.<br>
<br>
I want to write a joke so good that it somehow rights the rest of my life. That’s the nice thing about having demons. It makes you very productive.<br>
<br>
Working aloud, talking out every line, kept the show from sounding overly written.<br>
When you write alone, and have all the time in the world, you end up rewording sentences, editing and re-editing clauses, playing around with syntax - and your jokes tend to stiffen up as a result.<br>
They sound labored over — unnatural.<br>
<br>
At The Onion, the goal was to never have something sound like a joke. Comedy was delivered as fact. Because of that, we squeeze jokes into introductory clauses. We mix setups and punch lines together: a really dry and understated approach.<br>
<br>
The timing is different when something is performed versus when it’s read silently on a page.<br>
In front of a live audience - you want laughs.<br>
I love comedy that’s a slow burn, where it takes a couple of seconds to connect all the different bits of information in a joke before it lands.<br>
<br>
Mix emotions. I like comedy that has moments of heart in it, or sadness, or fear. I like comedy that makes people feel different things while they’re laughing.<br>
<br>
Nothing sharpens your writing faster than the desperate desire for validation. Having your self-worth inextricably linked to your work may be unhealthy, but it’s also responsible for most of my success.<br>
<br>
Rewriting is everything.<br>
Keep rewriting until you get what you want, and then write some more.<br>
<br>
You never finish anything, you just abandon it.<br>
When you say, “I can’t do better,” you stop.
