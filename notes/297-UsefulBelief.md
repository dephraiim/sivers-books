## Useful Belief - Chris Helder
> Recommendation: 3 / 10
    
### Description
Self-fulfilling beliefs. Focus on what is helpful to believe about a situation, and it can become true. Some good ideas, told in a weird way of a fictional guy getting on an airplane to speak at a conference.
    
### Notes
Useful belief: focusing on what is helpful in dealing with a situation we can't change.<br>
<br>
"I believe this is the greatest time ever to work in the nursing industry.<br>
 I don't know if that's actually true.<br>
 But because I believe it, it makes me better at my job."<br>
<br>
Truth is irrelevant.<br>
Once I have a useful belief about the present, I will see the opportunities.<br>
<br>
Example of a useful belief: you had the parents you were supposed to have.<br>
If you believe that, it is easier to make sense of what you learned from your parents and the importance they had on your life.<br>
<br>
Truth usually doesn't help you get the result you want.<br>
What matters is whether or not that idea is a useful thing to believe.<br>
Truth is subjective anyway.<br>
<br>
Parents complain about “kids today”.<br>
This is not a useful belief.  Beliving that this is the greatest generation of kids makes me a better parent.<br>
<br>
Most people do this unconsciously on some level. They try to make the best of every situation.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself at a conscious level, “What is the most useful belief I could have about this situation I'm walking into?”<br>
<br>
Successful people solve problems and keep moving forward.<br>
They ask themselves, “What is the most useful thing I could do right now? What strategy can I employ that would make this situation the best it can possibly be?”<br>
<br>
Truth is overrated.<br>
Useful is simply more important than true when it comes to empowering yourself.<br>
<br>
Is it useful to get angry?<br>
<br>
Useful beliefs:<br>
This is the best time in the history of the world to be in your industry/company/job.<br>
This is the greatest time ever to be a parent (and to be a child).<br>
Useful to see the opportunities.<br>
<br>
Useful belief to influence colleagues in the workplace: we're all members of a really exciting, innovative, well-informed generation.<br>
If I believe Generation Y is a great generation to manage, then I'm a better manager.<br>
<br>
Successful people see opportunities that unsuccessful people don't see.<br>
If you believe the markets are not going to let you make money, then you won't.<br>
If you believe the sales environment is terrible, you won't see ways to make sales.<br>
<br>
Inner power: to feel that everything will be okay. <br>
<br>
Regrets need to be transformed into opportunities for learning.<br>
<br>
Embrace a new useful belief for your business.<br>
The past is gone.<br>
That the way they did business in years gone by may not work today.<br>
Look at their current situation and ask themselves what they want to do about it.<br>
Accept and embrace a new reality.<br>
<br>
Useful belief: I can create my own reality.<br>
<br>
I used to let others dictate how I should fit into the box they had created for me.<br>
<br>
I came up with a series of useful beliefs for me, to guide me.<br>
<br>
Acting as if:<br>
To start implementing a change, act as if.<br>
Be the person you really want to be.<br>
Act as if you are that person.<br>
<br>
Meeting you can't avoid?  Adopt a useful belief about the meeting.<br>
Confident that something productive will come of it, or that you will learn something or encounter some new ideas.
