## The Five Rings - by Miyamoto Musashi
> Recommendation: 2 / 10
    
### Description
I thought it was going to be more broadly applicable philosophy. It was a little of that, but mostly sword technique.
    
### Notes
You should not have a favourite weapon. To become over-familiar with one weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well.<br>
<br>
Timing is important.<br>
<br>
There is timing in your whole life, in thriving and declining, in harmony and discord.<br>
<br>
Become acquainted with every art.<br>
<br>
Know the Ways of all professions.<br>
<br>
Do nothing which is of no use.<br>
<br>
If you merely read this book you will not reach the Way.<br>
<br>
Be determined though calm.<br>
Do not let your spirit be influenced by your body, or your body be influenced by your spirit.<br>
Be neither insufficiently spirited nor over spirited.<br>
An elevated spirit is weak and a low spirit is weak.<br>
<br>
See distant things as if they were close and to take a distanced view of close things.<br>
<br>
Enact strategy broadly, correctly and openly.
