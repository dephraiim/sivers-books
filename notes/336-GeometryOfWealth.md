## The Geometry of Wealth - by Brian Portnoy
> Recommendation: 2 / 10
    
### Description
I was expecting something more philosophical. Instead mostly just got advice to protect the downside.
    
### Notes
Three important steps:<br>
Define purpose: Illuminate the ingredients for a life well-lived<br>
Set priorities: Chart a focused strategy to do the right things in the right order<br>
Make decisions: Employ simplified tactics to drive better outcomes<br>
<br>
Wealth is funded contentment - the ability to underwrite a meaningful life.<br>
<br>
Priority #1 is risk management. It is to protect ourselves from the potential for loss, especially catastrophe.<br>
The proper mindset values avoiding mistakes over demonstrating brilliance.<br>
<br>
Nothing is so bitter that a calm mind cannot find comfort in it.<br>
<br>
The more information we gather, the worse choices we make.<br>
The more information we gather, the more compelled we feel to make decisions.<br>
We don’t like to harvest new information but then do nothing with it. It feels like wasted effort.<br>
<br>
Deliberation hinders satisfaction. At a certain point, putting too much thought into something undermines the value.<br>
Comparison shopping is mentally exhausting.<br>
<br>
Experiences are more immune to hedonic adaptation. They are harder to get used to, unlike material goods.<br>
Smaller, frequent experiences better defy the hedonic treadmill.<br>
<br>
Pay a small cost to avoid a potential catastrophe. And if the small cost led to large gains, even better.<br>
<br>
Survive. In the wild, rule one is stay alive. After that, it’s all upside.<br>
<br>
To achieve great things in life, to come out ahead, to make great investment returns, you need to put your capital at risk (human, financial, social, or otherwise).<br>
That could be paying for a pricey education, investing in the stock market, or asking the prettiest girl to the prom.<br>
But taking more risk does not produce greater returns. Instead, taking more risk increases the variability of future outcomes.<br>
If there were a reliable relationship between more risk and bigger rewards, then technically you wouldn’t be taking more risk. Everyone would bet long shots all the time.<br>
<br>
We want to be more right than others - to leverage our edge.<br>
Choosing the right pre-school, anticipating the next storm.<br>
<br>
At least at the start, we don’t want to be more right, we want to be less wrong. This is winning by not losing.<br>
The aim should be to control risk: “risk control” not “risk avoidance”.<br>
<br>
Great investors naturally think about being less wrong.<br>
They patiently wait until the odds are so stacked in their favor it would be foolish not to bet.<br>
<br>
Focus on minimizing the damage.<br>
<br>
Win not by making valid predictions but by allowing yourself to correct false ones.<br>
<br>
People may believe that who they are today is pretty much who they will be tomorrow, despite the fact that it isn’t who they were yesterday.<br>
<br>
Take the time to think differently about common problems.<br>
Always invert.<br>
<br>
Immunize your liabilities before you maximize your assets.<br>
<br>
To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier than most realize.<br>
To achieve superior results is harder than it looks.
