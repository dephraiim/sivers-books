## Writing to Learn - by William Zinsser
> Recommendation: 3 / 10
    
### Description
Part memoir, part writing instruction, but mostly just examples of good writing from different disciplines. The point is that writing well about a subject helps you learn it, and reading great writing about a subject makes a huge difference. But too much of the book were just examples that I didn’t find useful for my needs.
    
### Notes
Writing is primarily an exercise in logic.<br>
<br>
Begin with imitation.<br>
Read writers who were doing the kind of writing you want to do.<br>
Try to figure out how they did it.<br>
<br>
After a lifetime of writing I still revise every sentence many times and still worry that I haven’t caught every ambiguity.<br>
I don’t want anyone to have to read a sentence of mine twice to find out what it means.<br>
<br>
There is no typical anybody; every reader is different.<br>
Edit for yourself and write for yourself.<br>
Assume that if you consider something interesting or funny, a certain number of other people will too.<br>
<br>
The best minds in other disciplines would talk about how rhythm is at work in what they do.<br>
Symmetry and dissymmetry in molecular structure.<br>
Numerical repetition in the formation of crystals.<br>
Rhythmic movement of lake waters.<br>
Rhythm in painting.<br>
<br>
The reader should be given only as much information as he needs and not one word more.<br>
Anything else is a self-indulgence.<br>
<br>
Readers must be given room to bring their own emotions to a piece so crammed with emotional content.<br>
The writer must tenaciously resist explaining why the material is so moving.<br>
<br>
An idea can have value in itself, but its usefulness diminishes to the extent that you can’t articulate it to someone else.<br>
<br>
A great paper in philosophy tells me why the student couldn’t get where he wanted to go.<br>
Failure is often the beginning of wisdom.<br>
<br>
Teacher assigned students a paper that would be read aloud in class. It gets them to write for their peers and not for the teacher.<br>
<br>
In a poor paper, there’s not much in it to discuss - no place to start.<br>
<br>
Two kinds of writing:<br>
Explanatory writing: writing that transmits existing information or ideas.<br>
Exploratory writing: writing that enables us to discover what we want to say.<br>
<br>
Explanatory writing:<br>
Think!<br>
What do I want to say?<br>
Then try to say it.<br>
Have I said it?<br>
Put yourself in the reader’s mind:<br>
Is your sentence absolutely clear to someone who knows nothing about the subject?<br>
If not, think about how to make it clear. Then rewrite it.<br>
Then think:<br>
What do I need to say next?<br>
Will it lead logically out of what I’ve just written?<br>
Will it also lead logically toward where I want to go?<br>
If it will, write the sentence.<br>
Did it do the job I wanted it to do, with no ambiguity?<br>
If it did, think: Now what does the reader need to know?<br>
Keep thinking and writing and rewriting.<br>
If you force yourself to think clearly you will write clearly. It’s as simple as that.<br>
The hard part isn’t the writing; the hard part is the thinking.<br>
<br>
Exploratory writing is not a license to let it all hang out.<br>
However subconsciously they may stumble on what they want to say, they are finally as obligated as every other writer to make themselves understood.<br>
<br>
A simple style is the result of harder thinking and harder work.<br>
People who write obscurely are either unskilled in writing or up to mischief.<br>
<br>
Active verbs are a writer’s best friend.<br>
<br>
Show and tell.<br>
The writer should not only tell a story; he should try to make the reader see what he is writing about.<br>
<br>
We wish the writer had had a better time - or at least had given us that impression.<br>
The reader has to believe that the writer is feeling good.<br>

When I wrote my book “On Writing Well” I had a definite model in mind: Alec Wilder’s American Popular Song,
