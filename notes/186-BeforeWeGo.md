### Description
Collection of essays about fitness and weight lifting. I love all of Dan John's books. This one is one of his best. Nothing revolutionary. Just great reminders.
    
### Notes
The basic human movements in your training:<br>
Push, Pull, Hinge, Squat, Loaded, Carries.<br>
15-25 total rep range for each movement.<br>
If you can’t do 15 total reps, the load is too heavy.<br>
If you can easily do over 25 total reps, the load is too light.<br>
If you’re getting those reps and over time increasing the load, you’re getting it right.<br>
If you haven’t added plates in a while, consider this as the real issue behind your lack of progress.<br>
<br>
Squats can do more for total mass and body strength than probably all other lifts combined.<br>
Doing them wrong can do more damage than probably all the other moves, too.<br>
Push your knees out with your elbows.<br>
Get your chest up. Up!<br>
Puff up the chest, which tightens the lower back and locks the whole upper body.<br>
The lats naturally spread a bit and the shoulders come back a little.<br>
The torso is slung between the legs.<br>
<br>
Learn the single best lifting movement of all time: the goblet squat.<br>
Kettlebell cradled against your chest, squat down with the goal of having your elbows - which are pointed downward because you’re cradling the ’bell - slide past the inside of your knees.<br>
<br>
Let the body teach the body what to do.<br>
Try to keep your brain out of it!<br>
<br>
Where do you place your feet?<br>
Do three consecutive vertical jumps, then look down.<br>
This is roughly where you want to place your feet every time you squat.<br>
The toes should be out a little.<br>
<br>
Do grinding moves like double-kettlebell front squats (DKFS).<br>
<br>
The two greatest workouts I know: the ButtBurner 4000 and the Eagle.<br>
ButtBurner 4000:<br>
Grab a kettlebell or dumbbell in the 25-60lb range. Go lighter than you think.<br>
Now, do this: Perform one goblet squat, then one Bulgarian goat bag swing.<br>
Perform two goblet squats, then two Bulgarian goat bag swings.<br>
Now, three and three.<br>
Work your way up to ten and ten…if you can.<br>
<br>
You’re either progressing or regressing. There is no maintenance<br>
<br>
The 10,000-Swing Kettlebell Workout will rapidly transform your body in only four weeks.<br>
Use a 24kg kettlebell.<br>
Train two days on, one day off and repeat.<br>
Set 1: 10 reps<br>
Set 2: 15 reps<br>
Set 3: 25 reps<br>
Set 4: 50 reps<br>
You’ve now completed 100 reps - one cluster.<br>
Repeat the cluster four more times for a total of 500 swings.<br>
After each round of ten, fifteen and twenty-five reps, rest thirty to sixty seconds.<br>
After each set of fifty, the rest will extend to three minutes or more<br>
Stretch anything that needs it.<br>
Time your workouts. Each week you should be getting faster.<br>
<br>
The swing is a hip hinge.  Maximum hip bend and minimal knee bend. It is not a squat.<br>
<br>
A menu for every meal is going to save more time, energy and emotional breakdowns than anything else.<br>
<br>
We all have the discipline of monks when it comes to what we’re “going to eat.”<br>
<br>
The front squat is the best whole body lift.<br>
<br>
If all you did was clean and press, you could be awesome.  Massive shoulders and upper body development.<br>
<br>
Yoga will do marvels for mobility, flexibility, basic movements, groundwork and recovery.<br>
<br>
Add more plates. Rest more. Grow. Get stronger.<br>
<br>
Tumbling and rolling can improve work capacity and simultaneously change body composition.<br>
<br>
A complex is a series of lifts back to back where you finish the reps of one lift before moving on to the next.<br>
The barbell only leaves your hands or touches the floor after all of the lifts are completed.<br>
The key to organizing a complex is to make sure the bar passes over your head in some kind of logical manner.<br>
In other words, if you do rows followed by back squats, how did the bar get there?<br>
You need at least one intermediate move to get the bar onto your shoulders for the back squats.<br>
I try to have the bar pass backward over the head after a few lifts, but I only pass it forward again once.<br>
<br>
Those with the most variations in their training are usually the weakest and skinniest.<br>
<br>
When I want to increase work capacity and build mass, I only assign one complex for a six-week assault on bulking.<br>
<br>
Here’s my favorite complex:<br>
Row<br>
Clean<br>
Front squat<br>
Military press<br>
Back squat<br>
Good morning<br>
If the workout calls for 8 repetitions, you need to do 8 rows, followed by 8 cleans, 8 front squats, 8 military presses, 8 back squats and then 8 good mornings.<br>
<br>
Many of us didn’t allow our sons and daughters to watch TV on school nights.<br>
Maybe they miss some popular culture, but they become voracious readers and get skilled at games and sports.<br>
That’s the way deprivation works. You give up something and gain something that might even be better.<br>
<br>
Use heavy weights and slowly, steadily, build up the volume.<br>
<br>
Integrity, according to my mom, is being one person all the time no matter what the circumstances.<br>
Integrity comes from the same root as integer. Like a whole number, integrity asks you to be a whole person.<br>
<br>
Overhead squat, straight-leg deadlift, dip and pullup (done correctly) could do more for flexibility than all the ballet classes at charm school.<br>
<br>
The calendar is the single greatest training tool you have for success.<br>
The calendar is proactive. The calendar gives ideas about where you want to go and a bit of a roadmap to this destination.<br>
<br>
Every success in your life doesn’t call for several extra rounds of beer, a salutary doughnut and high fives from everyone.<br>
You’re an adult now; you don’t need a cookie every time you do something special.<br>
<br>
Instead of resting between exercises, plank between exercises.<br>
Getting up and down off the ground will drive the heart rate through the roof, not the actual plank.<br>
<br>
Do fifty reps.<br>
Bodyweight Squat<br>
Plan on taking some days off after you attempt this challenge.<br>
How many deadlifts can you do with 315 pounds in half an hour?<br>
<br>
The biggest gap in most people’s training the total lack of groundwork.<br>
<br>
Get a heart rate monitor and for five minutes, get down on the ground (vary the position, front or back or sides) and stand up.<br>
Repeat.<br>
Yes, that’s it. Now check that heart monitor.<br>
<br>
I’d come home from a long day and do these lifts:<br>
Overhead squat<br>
Straight leg deadlift<br>
Chinups (neck touching the bar)<br>
Dips<br>
Side bend of some kind<br>
Not only a tonic, refreshing workout, but I was stretched out by the moves.<br>
These movements tended to “put everything back into place.”<br>
I always walked away feeling better than when I started.<br>
<br>
Hypertrophy training becomes even more important as we age.<br>
Joint mobility is more important than practically everything else when it comes to dealing with the ills of age.<br>
In other words, stay lean, muscular and loose for as long as you can.<br>
<br>
Half an hour before I go to bed, I take the following: ZMA, Fish oil, A serving of sugar-free Metamucil<br>
With a glass of wine, you can feel the body relax.<br>
I think magnesium continues to be the most underrated of supplements, and its wonderful calming effects.<br>
<br>
Faced with a decision to keep climbing and probably die on Mount Everest or to come back to base camp, he came back down.<br>
But, he noted, he learned far more from this failure than he would have from succeeding.<br>
In a sense, success can dilute the lessons of life.<br>
Failure seems to prod most people into rethinking the attempts, the journey and the path.<br>
<br>
Don't get buttonholed in a job that stops you from exploring all the directions life presents.<br>
<br>
Many athletes quit the sport after the Olympics.<br>
The medal doesn’t fulfill the athletes as much as the dreams of victory during training.<br>
<br>
When you get your goals, dream up other goals.<br>
<br>
After age 28, the body seems to conspire to lose lean body mass and stiffen up.<br>
Jogging, while certainly better than nothing, tends to waste some muscle mass and lock up the joints.<br>
Just lift and get some crashless cardio in.<br>
<br>
Spend all the time you can spare on hypertrophy and joint mobility.<br>
<br>
TRX is a relatively new innovation I’ve grown to love.<br>
<br>
If you could only do one exercise: The one-arm press.  <br>
<br>
Doing pelvic tilts - or hip thrusts - are a one-stop shop for stretching the hip flexors.<br>
<br>
Are you taking fish oil?<br>
Because, if you’re not, you have totally missed the last decade of research.<br>
Fish oil capsules are so inexpensive and work so well that I can’t believe some people still don’t take them.<br>
<br>
As we age into our middle years and beyond, winning the fight to hold muscle mass is probably the single best indicator of health.<br>
<br>
If no one in a typical gym is doing something, it’s probably pretty hard to do.<br>
<br>
Rolling around on the floor doing getups is an insightful, thoughtful way to get reacquainted with getting off the ground.<br>
If you get on the ground and then get off the ground, you’ll stimulate a lot of fat loss.<br>
<br>
Here’s a great workout:<br>
Stand up.<br>
Now, get to the ground and lie on your back.<br>
Repeat this for five minutes.<br>
<br>
The ability to nap when necessary: I recommend squeezing a muscle tight, then breathing out and releasing it. This helps enable falling effortlessly asleep literally anytime, anywhere.<br>
I recommend ZMA, eyeshades, and earplugs.<br>
<br>
Weaknesses demand full concentration.<br>
Weaknesses need to be given full attention.<br>
<br>
If you have flexibility issues, I recommend the thirty-day yoga challenge (promise to go to ninety-minute sessions every day for 30).<br>
<br>
Start doing farmer walks, waiter walks, suitcase walk, sleds and pushing cars a few days a week.<br>
<br>
To become obese, you did something unbalanced.<br>
To get yourself back to sleek, lithe, firm and fantastic, you honestly can’t do a balanced approach.<br>
Finding balance at one hundred pounds over-weight will keep you there.<br>
He recommended an “unbalanced” approach to get back to your target.<br>
<br>
People walk up to the fireplace and say “give me heat.”<br>
The right way to do it is to get some paper, some kindling, some logs and light a match.<br>
Then you get some heat.<br>
<br>
One-arm overhead presses work the obliques better than all those odd side bends and twisties.<br>
<br>
2-3-5-2-3-5-2-3 is my favorite variation of the standard 5 × 5 protocol.<br>
Double, rest, a triple, rest, etc.<br>
<br>
For fat-loss exercise, discover things you’re terrible at and do them.<br>
<br>
I’m a huge fan of Steve Ilg’s book, Total Body Transformation.<br>
Pavel Tsatousline has a wonderful book, Relax into Stretch.
