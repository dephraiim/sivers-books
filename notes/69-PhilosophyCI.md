## Philosophy: a Complete Introduction - by Sharon Kaye
> Recommendation: 8 / 10
    
### Description
Very thought-provoking overview of philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Hume, Descartes, Kant, Nietzsche, Sartre. But the author does an AMAZING job of making everything incredibly clear, understandable, relateable, and applicable. So well-written. I’ve read a few books in this genre, but this is the best by far. I highly recommend this to anyone.
    
### Notes
Philosophers’ experiments take place in the mind, to explore possibilities.<br>
<br>
A thought experiment is an imaginary scenario designed to test an idea.<br>
<br>
Plato: Consider a perfect triangle. Though none are perfect, we can clearly identify which ones come closer to the ideal.<br>
Similarly: Justice, beauty, goodness and truth.<br>
The job of the philosopher is to study and promote the ideal.<br>
<br>
Plato: The view that the material world around us is not real is called idealism.<br>
Glimpse the Forms, perfect exemplars of our everyday experiences, and share the discovery.<br>
Those who recollect the Forms become the philosopher-kings.<br>
<br>
Plato is critical of the ‘lovers of sights and sounds’ who live life on a superficial level, never inquiring into the reality that lies beyond appearances.<br>
<br>
We each have a ruler, a soldier and a producer within us.<br>
Make sure that each does its job and stays free of corrosive influences.<br>
<br>
Reason stays in control, taking you ever further away from this world into a state of perpetual spiritual connection with the transcendent realm.<br>
<br>
Observe the people you admire most.<br>
<br>
Every situation that demands a choice has a wide variety of possible responses, ranging from deficient to excessive.<br>
The right response will always fall in the middle between those two extremes.<br>
The virtuous person avoids extremes.<br>
<br>
Extreme behaviour is often the result of emotional reactions.<br>
Use reason to control emotion and guide you towards a moderate response.<br>
<br>
(Although...)<br>
Ghandi, Mother Teresa, and many we admire were extremists.<br>
But maybe their apparent excess was really only moderation, considering the extreme circumstances they faced.<br>
<br>
Aristotle puts friendship above justice.<br>
Those who are friends have no need of justice.<br>
Those who are just still need friends.<br>
<br>
A friend is a second self.<br>
Looking at a true friend is like facing a mirror:<br>
You see your own achievements and failures reflected back at you.<br>
<br>
To be a great friend, you have to exercise your rational capacities.<br>
By doing this, you learn to act in accordance with the golden mean.<br>
<br>
When you see a purple onion, you can notice the purpleness it has in common with other purple objects.<br>
This means abstracting its colour away from its substance.<br>
You can think about purpleness all by itself, independently of any material object.<br>
But this does not mean that purpleness really exists in a transcendent realm beyond our world.<br>
It exists as a concept in our minds.<br>
For Aristotle, the same holds for justice, and beauty, and truth itself.<br>
<br>
Some say you have everything to gain and nothing to lose by believing in God.<br>
If you reason ‘I guess I should go to church and pray, just in case there is a powerful being who wants me to,’ you can just as easily reason ‘I guess shouldn’t go to church and pray, just in case there is a powerful being who doesn’t want me to.’<br>
What makes one line of reasoning any better than the other?<br>
<br>
Two different kinds of existence: mental and real.<br>
A painting first it exists in the mind of the artist, and then, after the artist creates it, it exists in reality.<br>
Atheists: God exists only in the mind.<br>
Theists: God exists both in the mind and also in reality.<br>
Both agree that God exists in the mind.<br>
<br>
Evil enhances our admiration of the good; for we enjoy and value the good more when we compare it.<br>
<br>
A priori: prior to, or independent of, experience of the world.<br>
A posteriori: after, or dependent upon, experience of the world.<br>
<br>
Doubt is the origin of wisdom.<br>
<br>
Imagine you are now in a sophisticated virtual-reality program.<br>
Nothing you seem to see is real.<br>
The purpose of this is to remove all certainties.<br>
<br>
To discover true knowledge, first question absolutely everything that you have ever believed.<br>
<br>
The beliefs you call knowledge have been far too carelessly acquired – picked up along the way in life without sufficient scrutiny.<br>
You believe what others tell you they saw and heard.<br>
Your mind is riddled with falsehoods that must be rooted out.<br>
It’s difficult, since they feel as comfortable and familiar as the truth.<br>
In fact, it’s almost impossible to distinguish between the two.<br>
The only solution is to clear-cut the forest – rid the mind of all beliefs, whether true or false – and begin again, this time carefully allowing only true beliefs to take root.<br>
<br>
Subjective conscious experience – what your love feels like – is a quale.<br>
Our minds are full of qualia: how cinnamon smells, what it’s like to perform.<br>
A complete scientific description of these phenomena from the outside does not capture what they are from the inside.<br>
<br>
Paul Churchland notes the elimination of witches from our serious ontology, and says the concepts of folk psychology – belief, desire, fear, sensation, pain, joy, and so on – await a similar fate.<br>
<br>
Those who believe in free will (known as metaphysical libertarians) say you can’t blame your parents for how you turned out. Your circumstances do not force your decisions.<br>
<br>
Man can do what he wants, but not want what he wants. — Schopenhauer<br>
You are free to do whatever you desire. But you are not free to choose your desires.<br>
<br>
Determinists allow that everyone feels as though they have free will.<br>
This is because we have a lot of contrary desires within us.<br>
When our desires are battling against each other, we pause, hovering, feeling as though we could equally go either way.<br>
But, in fact, the strongest desire always wins.<br>
<br>
Compatibilism: human freedom is compatible with determinism because it does not consist in free will but rather in the absence of external constraints.<br>
<br>
What would happen if government suddenly disappeared?<br>
How might human beings have behaved before there was such a thing as government?<br>
no industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain<br>
no culture of the earth<br>
no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea<br>
no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force<br>
no knowledge of the face of the earth<br>
no account of time<br>
no arts<br>
no letters<br>
no society<br>
and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.<br>
<br>
Government is legitimate only when the people willingly agree to subject themselves to it.<br>
<br>
We make a social contract to give up our natural rights in exchange for peace.<br>
This social contract theory stands in stark contrast to divine right theory, according to which God gives royal families the right to rule over a region regardless of how the people who are living there happen to feel about it.<br>
<br>
The veil of ignorance is a thought experiment in which you imagine that you don’t know anything about your personal identity.<br>
This way, you won’t inadvertently allow the social contract to be biased towards the advantage of any particular group.<br>
If you don’t know whether or not you might be disabled, for example, you’ll be sure to support laws that require public buildings to be accessible to disabled people.<br>
This veil of ignorance helps to guarantee a social contract that is as fair as possible to everyone.<br>
<br>
Ship of Theseus, with a twist:<br>
As the planks are removed, they are reassembled into another ship..<br>
Once all of Theseus’ planks are replaced, we have two ships: an old ship made of new planks and a new ship made of old planks!<br>
Which ship is the ship of Theseus?<br>
<br>
Apply Ship of Theseus to yourself.<br>
You look at your baby pictures and your relatives describe how you were as a baby.<br>
But was that little creature really you? You’ve changed so much in so many ways.<br>
The soul changes just as much as the body does.<br>
Amid all of this change, what stays the same? Is there an enduring self?<br>
<br>
The source of personal identity: memory.<br>
When you think about yourself you remember your past.<br>
The memory of what you have done is what makes those actions yours instead of someone else’s.<br>
<br>
Primary qualities, which include size (‘extension’), shape (‘figure’), quantity (‘number’) and motion, are objective because they really exist in the objects.<br>
Secondary qualities, which include colour, smell, taste and sound, are subjective, because they exist only in our minds.<br>
If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? No!<br>
A falling tree creates a disturbance in the air (a primary quality) that becomes a sound (a secondary quality) only for those who have ears.<br>
The same goes for taste and smell.<br>
These secondary qualities are mental interpretations of primary qualities.<br>
<br>
There is a gap between the following two statements: Things always behave this way. Things have to behave this way.<br>
Repetition is not the same as necessity.<br>
<br>
Einstein would never have dared to question the physics of Newton if it weren’t for Hume.<br>
<br>
No one has ever seen causation.<br>
If we saw behaviour just once, it wouldn’t occur to us to expect it to happen again.<br>
The repetition, however – the ‘constant conjunction’ of events – leads us to believe that it has to happen every time.<br>
<br>
Empiricists believe only what they experience.<br>
True empiricism requires a lot more scepticism.<br>
By applying scepticism towards all things unseen, including the supposed ‘laws of nature’, we will think more clearly and be less likely to develop a mistaken understanding of the world.<br>
<br>
Suppose someone claims to have witnessed a man raised from the dead.<br>
Hume asks us to consider how many times we have ever experienced such a thing occurring.<br>
He then asks us to consider how many times we have ever experienced someone lying to us or being mistaken about something they tell us.<br>
We should then decide to believe whichever we have experienced more often.<br>
<br>
He may, perhaps, perceive something simple and continued, which he calls himself.<br>
Though I am certain there is no such principle in me.<br>
<br>
Kant combines the best components from rationalists and empiricists.<br>
Recall the following categories:<br>
a priori: knowledge that does not depend on experience<br>
a posteriori: knowledge that depends on experience.<br>
matters of fact: observed truths, such as ‘bread nourishes’<br>
relations of ideas: logical truths, such as ‘two plus two equals four’.<br>
You would think that relations of ideas are always a priori and matters of fact are always a posteriori.<br>
In fact, this was everyone’s assumption before Kant arrived on the scene.<br>
Kant combines the a priori with matters of fact (which he calls ‘synthetic’) to create a new category of understanding which he calls the a priori synthetic.<br>
<br>
Kant asserts that time and space don’t exist in the world but rather are the way in which the rational mind understands the world.<br>
If there were no rational minds, there would be no time or space.<br>
<br>
Kant calls the physical world as it would be without the human concepts of time and space the noumenal realm, from the Greek word for ‘thought’.<br>
The noumenal realm consists of things-in-themselves, and transcends human experience.<br>
Kant calls the physical world as perceived through the human concepts of time and space the phenomenal realm, from the Greek word for ‘appearance’.<br>
The phenomenal realm consists of things-as-they-appear-to-us.<br>
<br>
If you’re thinking rationally, then you must act in accordance with the moral law.<br>
People make the mistake of thinking of duty in the form of hypothetical imperatives.<br>
For example: ‘If you want to have friends, then you must be kind.’<br>
Any such ‘If … then’ statement premises moral obligation (kindness) upon a desired outcome (having friends).<br>
Such an imperative cannot be ethical because you only need to deny the ‘if’ part to escape the obligation.<br>
If you don’t want to have friends, then you don’t need to be kind.<br>
True duty can only be conceived of in the form of a categorical imperative – a requirement that leaves room for no ‘ifs’, ‘ands’ or ‘buts’.<br>
For example: ‘Be kind.’ Period. It doesn’t matter what you want or need or feel.<br>
This is what is required of you as a rational being.<br>
<br>
All our duties can be captured in a single categorical imperative:<br>
“Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”<br>
<br>
Relativist Ruth Benedict (1887–1948) was an American anthropologist who travelled the world observing different cultures with different value systems.<br>
Benedict concludes that all morality is relative to the culture.<br>
<br>
By claiming that there is no legitimate way to make moral judgements, relativists deprive themselves of the ability to make any legitimate moral judgements.<br>
This is a self-contradiction, meaning the view has to be rejected or revised to avoid the contradiction.<br>
<br>
Thinking of lying for a good reason?<br>
Ask yourself whether the following would be a good law: ‘Everyone should always lie to protect themselves or others.’<br>
Categorical imperative is not motivated by a concern about the possible consequences of the proposed action.<br>
That would render it a hypothetical imperative, such as: ‘If you don’t want to live in a world full of liars, then don’t lie.’<br>
These hypothetical imperatives enable you to escape your duty to be honest.<br>
All you have to do is decide you don’t care about living with liars or running risks – then you are free to lie as much as you like.<br>
<br>
Duty is rationally inescapable.<br>
The point of universalizing your maxim is to see whether it would even be possible for a fully rational agent to engage in the proposed course of action.<br>
Kant insists that fully rational agents are incapable of committing immoral actions.<br>
Every immoral act is self-contradictory.<br>
Fully rational agents cannot contradict themselves.<br>
Therefore, fully rational agents cannot commit immoral acts.<br>
<br>
When you lie you’re not communicating, but undermining communication. So your very act negates itself – a self-contradiction.<br>
<br>
Universalizing your proposed actions means always regarding others as ends in themselves, never as the means to an end.<br>
<br>
It’s wrong to use people.<br>
If you hit someone for being annoying, you’re using them to relieve your frustration.<br>
Put our own selfish goals aside, striving instead to bring about a ‘kingdom of ends’.<br>
<br>
Nothing can be called good except a good will - good character.<br>
Courage, resolution, perseverance seem good, but may also become extremely bad and mischievous, if character is not good.<br>
<br>
You may make yourself utterly miserable trying to be a moral person.<br>
But in trying to be a moral person you will at least be worthy of happiness, which is far more important, in his view, than actually being happy.<br>
<br>
John Stuart Mill: utilitarianism.<br>
The ethical act is the one that produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.<br>
Your happiness counts just as much as, but no more than, anyone else’s.<br>
<br>
The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it.<br>
The sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it.<br>
<br>
Although it’s sometimes difficult to see, our own happiness is completely dependent on the happiness of those around us.<br>
<br>
Hedonic calculus, for quantifying pleasure:<br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensity (How strong is the pleasure?)<br>
2&nbsp;&nbsp;Duration (How long is the pleasure likely to last?)<br>
3&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainty (How likely is the act to produce the expected pleasure?)<br>
4&nbsp;&nbsp;Propinquity (How soon is the act expected to produce the pleasure?)<br>
5&nbsp;&nbsp;Fecundity (Is this pleasure liable to produce more pleasure?)<br>
6&nbsp;&nbsp;Purity (Is this pleasure likely to be accompanied or followed by pain?)<br>
7&nbsp;&nbsp;Extent (How many people will experience the pleasure?)<br>
Applying these criteria may yield surprising answers to moral dilemmas.<br>
<br>
Peter Singer’s interpretation of utilitarianism:<br>
Beings with preferences are capable of experiencing pleasure and pain, and hence are worthy of ethical consideration.<br>
Because animals have preferences, meat-eating and all forms of factory farming are morally wrong.<br>
Because human foetuses are incapable of having preferences (until 4½ months), abortion is not morally wrong.<br>
Because people with various forms of brain damage have no preferences, euthanasia (mercy killing) is not morally wrong.<br>
<br>
Since preferring luxuries is not as important as preferring basic needs, people in affluent nations are morally obligated to give their excess wealth to people in Third World nations.<br>
<br>
Utilitarianism is not about maximizing pleasure for oneself only – it’s about maximizing pleasure for everyone.<br>
So, if it turns out that Mozart can make a great deal of other people very happy with his music, then he is morally obligated to produce it.<br>
Mill distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures.<br>
He would argue that playing music is more valuable than merely listening, and that writing music is more valuable than merely playing, even though the difficulty increases in each case.<br>
Because the greater difficulty implies a greater satisfaction and value.<br>
Mill’s concern for higher pleasures adds, not an eighth way to quantify pleasure, but a whole new qualitative dimension. Concern for the quality of pleasures.<br>
<br>
Rule utilitarianism as opposed to act utilitarianism:<br>
When we are considering whether an act is ethical, we shouldn’t consider it alone as a one-time occurrence but rather as a type of action.<br>
Not asking, “Frame the homeless man or risk the riot?”<br>
Instead, you should ask yourself which is more conducive to happiness: defending human rights or ignoring human rights?<br>
<br>
Utilitarianism is sometimes called consequentialism because it is concerned not with principles but with results.<br>
<br>
Most people intend to love their life just as soon as ____________.<br>
Nietzsche viewed the ‘just as soon as’ mentality as the most significant problem of Western civilization.<br>
<br>
Suppose we are condemned to repeat our lives the same way over and over again for ever.<br>
Do whatever it takes to be sure you love every moment.<br>
<br>
Nietzsche implores us to evolve ‘beyond good and evil’.<br>
Morality is just a human construct, born of the ongoing struggle between individuals and groups for the only thing that really matters – power.<br>
The ‘will to power’: We are all pushing to seize the highest possible position in life.<br>
Make the most of it.<br>
<br>
Nietzsche despises religions, for their covert and hypocritical agenda.<br>
Christianity teaches that this life is just a transitory struggle on the way to heaven.<br>
But humility and sacrifice are slavish qualities, worthy only of servile, inferior beings.<br>
Slave morality always requires first an opposing world.<br>
Its action is basically reaction.<br>
<br>
God was a story the masters told to keep the slaves from rebelling.<br>
But there was a time when the story of God enlivened the people, inspiring them to achieve great things. This is what has died.<br>
<br>
Apollonian force is rational and law-like, maintaining strict order.<br>
Dionysian force is dangerous, cruel and wild. It seeks to unleash chaos.<br>
Both are required for a balanced, healthy existence.<br>
<br>
Socrates, whom Nietzsche regards as a menace rather than a hero, promoted the Apollonian, reinforced by Christianity, which strove to tame and deny all ecstatic instincts. The result is a highly repressed society.<br>
The solution, and the path to humanity’s next evolution, is to reintroduce the Dionysian force.<br>
<br>
The Übermensch lives deeply, richly and significantly without shying away from pain, because ‘that which does not kill us makes us stronger’.<br>
The Übermensch rejects all value systems while living life to the hilt.<br>
<br>
Nihilism means that there is no objective meaning in the world. Every belief is false because there is no true reason for anything.<br>
This realization is liberating. It forces one to realize that one is free to make one’s own meaning.<br>
<br>
Transform nihilism into perspectivalism?<br>
While there is no absolute truth, everyone can develop their own interpretation of the world.<br>
The radical freedom of interpretation.<br>
<br>
Philosophers are always asking whether things that seem to exist really do exist, up to Nietzsche, who concluded that nothing but the will to power exists.<br>
<br>
Suppose everyone has a small box with a beetle in it.<br>
No one is allowed to look in anyone else’s box.<br>
Instead, we talk about our beetles.<br>
Each seems to be a little different from every other.<br>
But how do I know you’re describing your beetle accurately?<br>
Come to think of it, how do I know you have a beetle at all?<br>
Does anyone really have a beetle?<br>
Perhaps we are all just playing a game.<br>
Likewise, we talk about the thoughts inside our heads, but we never get to see what’s really inside.<br>
<br>
Your friend says she believes in God.<br>
If she does nothing different from what she would do if she didn’t believe, then her belief may as well not exist.<br>
What is the belief other than the behaviour itself?<br>
<br>
Awareness of nothingness is a state of mind.<br>
You have to notice the things you are not in order to realize you are free.<br>
<br>
Man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards.<br>
Existence precedes essence.<br>
<br>
He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself.<br>
There is no human nature.<br>
He is what he wills.<br>
Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.<br>
<br>
Freedom is what you do with what’s been done to you.<br>
<br>
One of the chief motives for artistic creation is the need to feel that we are essential to the world.<br>
It connects us to other human beings so that we aren’t alone in our freedom.<br>
<br>
We think only when we are confronted with problems.<br>
Art and technology: each is the solution to a problem.<br>
While art solves an internal problem, technology solves an external one.<br>
Language is the ultimate tool of tools.<br>
<br>
The institutions created by words and pictures – including religion, science and politics – are technologies.<br>
We can admire or despise them just like any work of art.<br>
They are human inventions, created to solve particular problems.<br>
If an institution creates more problems than it solves, then it has outlived its usefulness and must be replaced.<br>
<br>
Just as there is no absolute beauty, there is no absolute truth.<br>
<br>
If you moved through the world effortlessly, accomplishing all your goals without a single challenge, you would never acquire knowledge.<br>
<br>
John Dewey:<br>
Students studied chemistry, not by memorizing formulas but by baking biscuits.<br>
They studied geometry, not by deducing axioms, but by making patterns to sew their own clothes.<br>
<br>
Education is a process of living, not a preparation for future living.
