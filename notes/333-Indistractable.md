## Indistractable - by Nir Eyal
> Recommendation: 2 / 10
    
### Description
A specific guide for how to avoid distraction in your life. 95% of it was how-to stuff I didn't find useful because I'm already doing all of it. If you're not, this book is much more useful to you. It had two interesting points for me: about dissatisfaction driving motivation, and filling your daily calendar with a template of how you want to spend your day.
    
### Notes
Even when we think we’re seeking pleasure, we’re actually driven by the desire to free ourselves from the pain of wanting.<br>
<br>
The drive to relieve discomfort is the root cause of all our behavior.<br>
<br>
Dissatisfaction propels us to do everything we do.<br>
<br>
Even selfless acts are motivated by our need to escape feelings of guilt and injustice.<br>
<br>
To master distraction, we must learn to deal with discomfort.<br>
<br>
Instead of suppressing urges, step back, notice, observe, and let the desire disappear naturally.<br>
<br>
Doing research is often just a diversion from difficult work.<br>
<br>
In a smoking cessation study, the participants who had learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit at double the rate of those in the American Lung Association’s best-performing cessation program.<br>
Tell myself it’s fine to give in, but not right now. I have to wait just ten minutes.<br>
<br>
When you gently pay attention to negative emotions, they tend to dissipate - but positive ones expand.<br>
<br>
The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.<br>
<br>
Labeling yourself as having poor self-control actually leads to less self-control.<br>
<br>
Only by setting aside specific time in our schedules for traction (the actions that draw us toward what we want in life) can we turn our backs on distraction.<br>
<br>
Eliminate all white space on your calendar so you’re left with a template for how you intend to spend your time each day.<br>
<br>
Success is measured by whether you did what you planned to do.<br>
<br>
Ulysses pact: a freely made decision that is designed and intended to bind oneself in the future. It's pre-commitment.
