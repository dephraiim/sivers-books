> Recommendation: 5 / 10
    
### Description
I like Joe and love what he’s done with his Genius Network. The book is a good reminder of the importance of networking, and some insights from an expert.
    
### Notes
“Networking” has come to mean shallow conversations, transactional relationships, and the anxiety of impressing other people so that they’ll do something for you.<br>
<br>
People who are interested in personal development read a lot of books. They are always looking for new ideas and concepts to take them to the next level.<br>
<br>
If you understood the atmospheric conditions of everyone’s life, it would make sense why they do what they do and why they behave the way they behave.<br>
The better you understand their context, the better you can connect.<br>
We multiply our suffering through our attachment to the thoughts and stories we tell ourselves about our experiences<br>
Ask about anyone, “How are they suffering, and how can I help?”<br>
<br>
People get stuck in small talk because they don’t know how to listen or how to genuinely be themselves.<br>
<br>
Selling is getting someone intellectually engaged in a future result that’s good for them, and getting them to emotionally commit to take action to achieve that result.<br>
<br>
Know who you are, be honest about that, and focus on the other person.<br>
Bring your real self to interactions.<br>
To connect with other people, you have to be okay with yourself.<br>
<br>
Communicating = an exchange of energy and information.  Exploring each other and learning.<br>
Connecting = beyond communication, forming a deeper bond.<br>
<br>
Using rapport to connect with people is great, but using rapport to manipulate is wrong.<br>
To have rapport, you first develop comfort and trust.<br>
Comfort must come first.<br>
<br>
Trust is comfort plus time.<br>
How do we know that they’re not just on their best behavior?<br>
What if what they’re showing us is a front?<br>
What if they’re trying to get something from us by being funny or nice or helpful?<br>
In truth, deep trust can only be established over time, because time proves a person’s reliability.<br>
<br>
Mention a weakness or shortcoming before mentioning your strengths.<br>
<br>
Ask people three great questions:<br>
Where are you?<br>
Where do you want to go?<br>
How are you going to get there?<br>
(also great to apply to yourself)<br>
<br>
I invest more time, attention, money, effort, and energy into my relationships than I do anything else, and I do so on the longest timeline possible.<br>
<br>
What problem needs to be solved in your life?<br>
What would your life or business look like if you were able to solve that problem?<br>
What would the three biggest benefits be of solving that problem?<br>
Who do you know who can help you solve the problem?<br>
<br>
Be useful, grateful, and valuable to people.<br>
Who are the people that you would always answer the phone for and what kind of traits do they have in common?<br>
<br>
You don’t fall in love with another person; you fall in love with who you get to be around them.<br>
<br>
Relax into being who you most want to be.<br>
<br>
People who have had extremely negative or traumatic experiences can be attracted to people and situations that make them feel the same way because it’s familiar.<br>
What causes me pain?<br>
What am I overly sensitive about?<br>
What am I not sensitive enough about?<br>
What am I biased toward?<br>
Based on my life experiences, where might I have some blind spots?<br>
Did you learn some of those things from your family?<br>
Write down explanations from your past about why you wrote what you did.<br>
Did you learn some of those things from your family?<br>
From romantic relationships?<br>
From friendships or your environment?<br>
Write down what you learned about yourself - and how you will plan to lean into your strengths and be more aware of your weaknesses.<br>
<br>
What is hysterical is historical.<br>
If you overreact or underreact to something, that reaction is tied to something that happened in your past.<br>
<br>
You are paid for your work in five distinct ways: by being...<br>
utilized<br>
rewarded<br>
appreciated<br>
referred<br>
enhanced<br>
<br>
The difference between lettuce and garbage is timing.<br>
<br>
You can gauge the value of many relationships by how often you laugh with the other person.<br>
<br>
A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness.<br>
<br>
If you have a desire to act on a goal and don’t act immediately, your brain basically kills it.<br>
<br>
When someone reaches out to my team or runs into me in person and asks, “Can I interview you for my podcast?” I ask, “Have you listened to any of my other podcasts?”<br>
<br>
People want me to connect them to people I know without providing something of value that makes the connection make sense.<br>
I can’t make introductions based on half-baked requests.<br>
<br>
Be well positioned, high-status (earned, not faked), valuable, and useful so people want to go deeper and learn more about you.
