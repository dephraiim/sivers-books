## The Bed of Procrustes - by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
> Recommendation: 6 / 10
    
### Description
I'm thrilled if I get a few counter-intuitive thought-provoking ideas from any source. This book is filled with his usual cocktail party sprezzatura bravado, but refreshingly succinct, minus his usual blowhard explanations of his superior scholarly approach to life.
