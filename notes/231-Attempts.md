### Description
I love his writing about fitness and strength. Nothing unconventional except his focus on the fundamentals and basics.
    
### Notes
Fit for what?<br>
Fitness is the ability to do a task.<br>
<br>
If you can survive in your home for three days, statistically, the worst of most disasters will be behind you.<br>
<br>
Invest wisely in asymmetrical risks.<br>
<br>
Lightweight hiking / trekking is basically: A sleep system, food system, carrying system.<br>
<br>
For personal trainers and coaches alike, the first of the year is a good time for business and a bad time for success.<br>
<br>
It’s the road, not the inn.<br>
<br>
It’s not where you start, it’s where you finish.<br>
<br>
We all knew dozens of people who wanted to be dancers, singers, artists and athletes who discovered much more fun things to do with their time.<br>
Talk openly and honestly about the wonderful things in life that conspire to cut off the knees of our brilliant goal-setting.<br>
It keeps people on track.<br>
Fill the pot of “the pleasure of achieving a goal” as richly as you can.<br>
<br>
One of your dreams will come true. But many other things you want will not happen.<br>
<br>
I could do a million things. But I choose to do this. And I accept the fact that I will be giving up a million things.<br>
<br>
The hatred of failure is an amazing lever to push people in the right direction.<br>
<br>
What ideas about strength and conditioning do I have that are unconventional?<br>
None.<br>
None of what I do is weird, unconventional or unusual.<br>
Doing the basics - the fundamentals - is probably unusual in a field noted for quacks and quick-buck artists.<br>
<br>
Coaching is named after a vehicle that takes one from here to there.
