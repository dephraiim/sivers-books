## Open Borders - by Bryan Caplan
> Recommendation: 8 / 10
    
### Description
A nonfiction comic book, by an economist, about unrestricted immigration. What? Yeah. Everyone should read it. This fun easy read of a single well-argued point will change your mind no matter what your previous stance. Brilliant illustration by Zach Weinersmith helps make the topic stick. NOTE: Don’t try to read it on a little black-and-white Kindle. It really is a comic book and needs to be read full-size in color.
    
### Notes
We live in a global apartheid, based not on the race of your parents, but the nation of your parents.<br>
<br>
Immigration laws discriminate - telling people where they can live or work - based on the wealth of the country they were born in.<br>
<br>
People should be judged not by the nation of their birth, but by the content of their character.<br>
<br>
Philosopher Michael Huemer’s "Starving Marvin" scenario:<br>
Marvin is starving - in desperate need of food.<br>
So he goes to the marketplace to buy bread.<br>
But Sam intentionally blocks the way, preventing Marvin from getting there.<br>
So Marvin dies.<br>
Sam’s blockade was an act of murder.<br>
<br>
U.S. had open borders until the 1920s, and thrived because of it.<br>
<br>
People working in desolate places - places inhospitable for wealth creation (metaphor: farming the Antarctic) - are contributing nothing to the global economy.<br>
Open borders - allowing anyone to work anywhere - would bring 50% to 150% gains in gross world product.<br>
<br>
Mass production is needed to sustain mass consumption.<br>
When workers produce more stuff, almost everyone is better off.<br>
<br>
Companies pay more in rich countries than in poor countries because the workers are more productive there than at home.<br>
<br>
Open borders makes poverty visible.  Living in the first world, global poverty is invisible to you.<br>
<br>
Some places decline in population.  Like rural Nebraska, for example.  Or Ireland during the potato famine.  But imagine if migration out of there wasn’t allowed.  It would create a zombie economy and tear itself apart.<br>
Labor mobility enriches and saves lives.<br>
<br>
Immigrants cause less crime than natives.  Foreign-born incarceration rates are a third lower than native-born rates.<br>
Naturalized immigrants are one-fifth of natives’ incarceration rate.<br>
<br>
Restricting immigration is like the old medical solution of amputating, with a saw, any part of you that had a problem.  Poverty? Restrict immigration!  Fiscal collapse? Restrict immigration!  Etc.<br>
But like keyhole surgery now gets specific to fix the problem, these problems should be fixed specifically, not by resorting to restricting immigration.
