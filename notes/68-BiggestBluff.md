## The Biggest Bluff - by Maria Konnikova
> Recommendation: 8 / 10
    
### Description
Amazing use of poker to form a philosophy of probability, intuition, instant karma, taming your emotions, treating triumph and disaster the same, and agency. Brilliant writing, mixing real-life events with philosophical pauses. Rare mix of riveting and thoughtful. Combine with “Thinking in Bets” by Annie Duke.
    
### Notes
The more you overestimate your own skill relative to luck, the less you learn from what the environment was trying to tell you, and the worse your decisions become.<br>
When you think you know more than you do, you ignore any signs to the contrary.<br>
The illusion of control prevented real control from emerging.<br>
Before long, the quality of your decisions deteriorate.<br>
<br>
You did what worked in the past, or what you had decided would work - and failed to grasp that the circumstances had shifted so that a previously successful strategy was no longer so.<br>
You failed to see what the world was telling you when that message wasn’t one you wanted to hear.<br>
<br>
People fail to internalize numeric rules, making decisions based on things like “gut feeling” and “intuition” and “what feels right” rather than based on the data they are shown.<br>
We need to train ourselves to see the world in a probabilistic light - and even then, we often ignore the numbers in favor of our own experience.<br>
We believe what we want to see, not what research shows.<br>
<br>
The reaction isn’t in line with the statistics.<br>
You’ve overcompensated because you went through a bad experience.<br>
You’ve undercompensated because the statistics haven’t ever affected you personally.<br>
<br>
Our experiences overcome everything else, but mostly, those experiences are incredibly skewed: they teach us, but they don’t teach us well.<br>
<br>
When you imbue probability with emotion, it becomes luck.<br>
<br>
Betting on uncertainty is one of the best ways of understanding it.<br>
<br>
Immanuel Kant proposes betting as an antidote to one of the great ills of society: false confidence bred from an ignorance of the probabilistic nature of the world,<br>
<br>
To our minds, 99 percent, even 90 percent, basically means 100 percent.<br>
<br>
The offer of a bet makes you pause.<br>
Now that you have something real at stake, you have to reevaluate just how sure of a sure thing your opinion really is.<br>
You become aware of the possibility of your being mistaken.<br>
<br>
Kids learn so much better - and remember what they’ve learned - if they know exactly how or when they’ll apply the knowledge.<br>
<br>
It’s easy to have an illusion of skill when you’re not immediately called out on it through feedback.<br>
<br>
Until you start playing a lot, it’s just information overload.<br>
Know the dangers of too much information in an experience-free vacuum.<br>
<br>
Are you thinking correctly?<br>
You need a way of testing your thought process.<br>
The only way to do that is by failing.<br>
Everyone plays well when they’re winning. But can you control yourself and play well when you’re losing?<br>
<br>
Treat triumph and disaster the same.<br>
The wins really go to people’s heads. And the losses - they can’t deal.<br>
If we lose early, we have a shot at objectivity.<br>
But when we win at the start, that’s when we see the illusion of control.<br>
<br>
There is no answer. It’s a constant process of inquiry.<br>
<br>
In any interaction, you want to have as much information as possible.<br>
When you’re the person acting last, you have the best of it.<br>
You already know your opponents’ decisions, their plays, their opening bids.<br>
In a negotiation, you have the power.<br>
In an argument or debate, you have the power.<br>
You know more than they do. They have to initiate. You have the benefit of responding.<br>
<br>
Not playing scared is not the same thing as being aggressive. It means not making decisions because you’re afraid.<br>
You can’t play scared.<br>
You can’t be afraid of how you look.<br>
You can’t be afraid someone will walk away because of what you do or don’t do.<br>
You have to play smart.<br>
<br>
How we frame something affects not just our thinking but our emotional state.<br>
The words we select - the ones we filter out and the ones we eventually choose to put forward - are a mirror to our thinking.<br>
Clarity of language is clarity of thought.<br>
The expression of a certain sentiment, no matter how innocuous it seems, can change your learning, your thinking, your mindset, your mood, your whole outlook.<br>
The language we use becomes our mental habits - and our mental habits determine how we learn, how we grow, what we become.<br>
<br>
Bad beats drag you down.<br>
They focus your mind on something you can’t control - the cards - rather than something you can, the decision.<br>
<br>
The most we can do is make the best decision possible with the information we have; the outcome doesn’t matter.<br>
<br>
My favorite poet, W. H. Auden:<br>
“Choice of attention - to pay attention to this and ignore that - is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer.<br>
 In both cases man is responsible for his choice and must accept the consequences.”<br>
<br>
Overconfidence in your opinion comes from thinking you know more than you do simply because you have more information available to you.<br>
<br>
You’re not lucky because more good things are actually happening; you’re lucky because you’re alert to them when they do.<br>
You can be on the alert for it, prepare yourself to recognize it and profit by it when it comes.<br>
To be successful, we need to train our powers of observation, to cultivate that attitude of mind of being constantly on the look-out for the unexpected and make a habit of examining every clue that chance presents.<br>
<br>
Poker is exactly like life, but with instant karma.<br>
<br>
Before you do anything, think ahead to how that action fits into your narrative arc.<br>
If it doesn’t, well, perhaps it won’t work out the way you’d like it to.<br>
You need to be aware enough of your own narrative that it coheres, comes together, makes sense.<br>
<br>
Why are people doing what they’re doing?<br>
If you haven’t thought through the motivation, the behavior will be off.<br>
They’ll suddenly do things that make no sense.<br>
<br>
Why are you acting this way?<br>
Never judge anything others do without asking the same question.<br>
<br>
Too much studying without playing makes it hard to fully absorb knowledge.<br>
<br>
“tilt”: to inject emotion into your decision process.<br>
<br>
We often argue with the truth.<br>
If someone gives us our actual thought process, we dismiss it in favor of the version we’ve constructed for ourselves.<br>
<br>
We’re incredibly good at is making excuses for ourselves and crafting explanations for why we’re still as good as we thought.<br>
<br>
People don’t fare any better than a coin toss at deciding whether someone is lying or telling the truth.<br>
Even with significant training, people are unlikely to spot the practiced deceiver.<br>
The face, in the end, is not a particularly good metric - and the eyes are certainly not the window into the soul.<br>
<br>
Personality is all about context.<br>
Nuance of humanity.<br>
Don't strip traits from context. Don't give people global scores.<br>
Maybe I’m conscientious at work but a slob at home, or agreeable in the face of authority but a sudden bully in the schoolyard.<br>
<br>
Avoid situations where skill falls by the wayside, where you have to rely on variance alone to break your way because you simply can’t measure up otherwise.<br>
<br>
Seek out situations where you’re a favorite; avoid those where you’re an underdog.<br>
<br>
The why shouldn’t ever be for the simple glory of saying you’ve done something.<br>
<br>
We tend to be overly optimistic when we map out timelines, goals, targets, and other horizons.<br>
We look at the best-case scenario instead of using the past to determine what a more realistic scenario would look like.<br>
<br>
You need to think in terms of preparation. Don’t worry about hoping. Just do.<br>
<br>
Stock market returns have been found to be lower on days with greater cloud cover - and higher when a favorite sports team wins.<br>
Over and over, incidental events affect decisions they shouldn’t actually influence, simply because they affect how we’re feeling.<br>
Tell people what’s going on, though, and they can often overcome it. Exmaple: by asking, “How’s the weather down there?”<br>
In other words, if our attention is drawn to the actual cause of our mood, it stops having an effect.<br>
<br>
Denying luck individually is to suggest that we have much greater agency than we really have over outcomes in our lives.
