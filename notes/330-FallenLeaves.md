## Fallen Leaves - by Will Durant
> Recommendation: 2 / 10
    
### Description
I usually love his writing style and philosophical historical perspective, but unfortunately in this book I loved neither.
    
### Notes
Our grasp is greater than our reach; but therefore our reach is made greater than that grasp.<br>
<br>
Our children bring us up by showing us, through imitation, what we really are.<br>
<br>
A man is as young as the risks he takes.<br>
<br>
Noise is the vital medium of youth.<br>
<br>
To be busy is the secret of grace, and half the secret of content.<br>
Let us ask the gods not for possessions, but for things to do.<br>
Happiness is in making things rather than in consuming them.<br>
<br>
In Utopia, each would build his own home.<br>
<br>
Life that educates, and perhaps love more than anything else in life. <br>
<br>
Discovering the world, youth discovers evil, and is horrified to learn the nature of his species.<br>
The principle of the family was mutual aid, but the principle of society is competition, the struggle for existence, the elimination of the weak and the survival of the strong.<br>
Youth, shocked, rebels, and calls upon the world to make itself a family, and give to youth the welcome and protection and comradeship of the home.<br>
Then slowly youth is drawn into the gamble of this individualistic life.<br>
The zest of the game creeps into the blood.<br>
Acquisitiveness is aroused and stretches out both hands for gold and power.<br>
The rebellion ends.<br>
The game goes on.<br>
<br>
We are living flames of desire until we admit final defeat.<br>
<br>
Character is the sum of our desires, fears, propensities, habits, abilities, and ideas.
