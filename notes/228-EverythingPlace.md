## Everything in Its Place (Work Clean) - by Dan Charnas
> Recommendation: 5 / 10
    
### Description
Mise-in-place. Chefs spend more time planning than actually cooking. The success of the kitchen depends on its processes. Apply this to your work.
    
### Notes
Chef means “boss.”<br>
In French, “chef” is the equivalent of the English word chief.<br>
In English, the term chef became aligned with the culinary world as a shortened form of the French title chef de cuisine, chief of the kitchen.<br>
<br>
“Restaurant” literal meaning: place of restoration, so named for the restorative soups (restaurants) that several of these early establishments sold.<br>
<br>
Strongly hold on to your regimen of good habits in a world that will tempt you to ditch them without any immediate consequence.<br>
<br>
Mise-en-place central values: preparation, process, and presence.<br>
<br>
Do all you can to set yourself up for success.<br>
<br>
Good process not only makes the work better but also makes you better.<br>
Refine good process: how can you do this better, or easier, or with less waste?<br>
<br>
The night before, do anything you need to do so you can start the next day centered and ready.<br>
<br>
Chefs become planning machines so they can become cooking machines.<br>
<br>
It takes longer to plan and prepare than it does to cook.<br>
<br>
Make lists, not only of the things you know you need to do, but everything you might need to do.<br>
<br>
For your most important categories of tasks, log your times for a month, and see if they average out.<br>
How many small tasks, like returning e-mails, can you complete in an hour, on average?<br>
Determine the length of a “minimum session” to write an article.<br>
<br>
Take 30 minutes to clean your physical and virtual spaces, clear your mind, and plot your day.<br>
<br>
Schedule your actions.<br>
There is no difference between a task and an appointment.<br>
They both need your time and your presence.<br>
This difference has long been maintained by the two different tools we use for each: the “to-do” list and the calendar. But it is a false difference.<br>
The “to-do” list without appointments lures us into packing lots of tasks onto it without thinking about when they will actually get done.<br>
A calendar with only appointments on it misleads us into thinking we have an open schedule when in fact we don’t.<br>
<br>
Get everywhere fifteen minutes early.<br>
Getting there early applies especially to the appointments you make with yourself because those are the appointments you are least likely to keep - having no one to answer to but yourself.<br>
<br>
Make the kitchen and the spaces within it as small as possible, so that you don’t have to take a step.<br>
<br>
The cleaner her station, the faster she worked.<br>
Working clean: keeping that system of organization no matter how fast and furious the work is.<br>
<br>
An action taken now has immeasurably more impact than a step taken later because the reactions to that action have more time to perpetuate.
