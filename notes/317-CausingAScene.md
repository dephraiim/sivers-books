## Causing a Scene - by Charlie Todd
> Recommendation: 3 / 10
    
### Description
Fun tales from the guy that invented Improv Everywhere. Not really educational as much as just fun, and I'm a huge fan of their “missions”.
    
### Notes
Rather than wait for some sort of mythical big break, I decided I’d make all of New York my stage and perform anywhere and everywhere.<br>
<br>
The Improv Everywhere philosophy: this mission would cause a scene of joy and give a stranger quite a story to tell.<br>
<br>
Many people who watched the video thought our mission was some sort of political commentary or a statement on the human condition. (It’s not: it’s just a scene of chaos and joy like all of our other missions.)
