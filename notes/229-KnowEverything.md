> Recommendation: 5 / 10
    
### Description
Really how to ask better questions. How to learn through conversational questioning and listening.
    
### Notes
Look for answers by talking things through with someone who asks the right questions, so that you can become wiser together.<br>
<br>
Flexible thinking is where you decide to switch your point of view or jump aboard another person’s train of thought to see where it takes you.<br>
<br>
Bring unconscious ideas, assumptions and beliefs to the surface.<br>
<br>
Philosophising: not-knowing, asking questions, searching for answers.<br>
<br>
If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first fifty-five minutes determining the proper question to ask.<br>
<br>
We ask too many questions out of the blue, and often they are incomplete, suggestive, rhetorical, ill-timed or questions that aren’t questions at all.<br>
<br>
A question is an invitation.<br>
An invitation to think, explain, sharpen, dig deeper, provide information, investigate, connect.<br>
A good question is clearly formulated and is born of an open, curious attitude.<br>
A good question remains focused on the other person and their story.<br>
A good question gets someone thinking.<br>
A good question leads to clarification, new insights or a new perspective for the recipient.<br>
A good question is not intended to give advice, check hypotheses, impose a point of view, share an opinion, make a suggestion or leave the other person feeling judged or cornered.<br>
<br>
What an in-depth conversation does entail is an exploration of the experience of one of the participants and a closer examination of the ideas, concepts and questions at play, not least notions about human nature.<br>
<br>
We might be too enthusiastic in sharing our own story, experience or viewpoint at the expense of exploring the other person’s deep enough first.<br>
<br>
An in-depth conversation should be a stimulating and shared undertaking, and a joint search for wisdom.<br>
<br>
Talking about yourself feels so much nicer than asking questions.<br>
<br>
An opinion makes more of an impression than a question.<br>
<br>
The right questions help you think more clearly.<br>
<br>
Our own story is not really all that interesting.<br>
The truly intense and enriching conversations are to be found in what other people are thinking.<br>
<br>
Becoming wiser is a joint endeavour, and another person’s mind is the place where you can find new insights.<br>
<br>
People cling to their opinions even more tightly when confronted with evidence to the contrary.<br>
We tend to use facts like a drunk uses a lamppost. Not for illumination, but simply for support.<br>
Wonder can also be applied to everyday situations.<br>
Choose to look at a situation with wonder.
